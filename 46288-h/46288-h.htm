<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>How All Things Began</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ONG, long ago, before the earth was made,&mdash;and
there was no sea and sky or night
and day,&mdash;the vast, unending Land of Mist
stretched away on one side of a bottomless gulf,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on
the other side of which lay the Land of Fire. The
Land of Mist was called Niflheim, and here eternal
winter reigned with fog and snow and darkness that
wrapped the dreary land about like a shroud. From
the heart of Niflheim there flowed a dark, tumultuous
river, and as it rushed down into the chasm at its
edge, the waters met the cold blasts that swept up
from below, and great mountains of ice were formed
on the side of the gulf over which the chill fogs gathered
and the bitter winds blew.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a></span>
It is called in the Eddas &ldquo;Ginungagap.&rdquo; <a href="#FNanchor_1_1">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The never changing twilight which brooded over
the gulf was sometimes illuminated by sparks that
were blown over from the Land of Fire that lay just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
beyond. This place was called Muspelheim, and
here the whole land glowed like a living furnace with
flames that burned with the heat of a million suns.
Sparks of fire flew up in great numbers into the
clouds, and these, glowing like balls of fire, were
thrown far and wide on the land. Some of the
burning sparks floated northward toward the land
of snows, and as they fell into the ice-filled gulf,
they changed to clouds of steam which were soon
congealed into hoar-frost. Then one day this great
mass of frost, on which fresh sparks of fire still fell,
was suddenly warmed into life, and out of ice and
snow and fire and heat the great giant Ymir was
made.</p>

<p>Now although Ymir was fashioned out of these
strange elements and so never felt the cold, he was
soon very hungry in his home of ice and snow, and
there was no food to be found anywhere. For a long
time the giant wandered over the frost-bound land,
and then one day he came upon the gigantic cow Audhumbla,
who stood among the ice-hills calmly chewing
her cud. From her udders flowed four streams
of milk, and this was more than enough to satisfy
the giant&rsquo;s hunger. He never strayed far from the
wonderful cow, and one day, as he watched her licking
salt from the blocks of ice, he was surprised to
see a head suddenly appear through the melting ice.
Audhumbla kept on licking with her strong, rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
tongue, and soon the whole body of a man emerged.
As this strange being stood before the eyes of the
astonished Ymir, the giant was filled with fear and
hatred, for he knew that from the mighty Iceman<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
would spring a new race that would soon make war
upon the giants and destroy them.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
His name was Bure, and his son was Bor, the father of
Odin, Vile and Ve. <a href="#FNanchor_2_2">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is, indeed, just what did happen later on, for
from the children of the Iceman came the gods Odin,
Vile and Ve, who began at once to make war upon
Ymir and all his kindred. In the terrible battle
that took place between the gods and giants, Ymir
was killed; and from his body poured forth such a
great river of blood that all of the giants were
drowned in it except two. These were Bergelemer
and his wife, who escaped on a chest that floated
away to the edge of the world. From them sprang a
new race of frost-giants who continued to make
trouble for the gods just as their forefathers had done.</p>

<p>Then Odin<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> took the body of Ymir, and with the
help of his brothers he fashioned from it the earth
and the sea and the sky. From the great masses of
flesh they formed the earth, and all around it they
planted Ymir&rsquo;s eyebrows to make a high fence as
a protection against the frost-giants. His immense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
bones they shaped into hills, and out of his teeth they
made the cliffs, while his thick hair they used for
trees and bushes and grass. His blood supplied the
boundless ocean, and his skull formed the arching
sky in which the gods placed some of the sparks that
floated out of Muspelheim. These they caught and
set in the heavens and called them stars. The sky
was held in place by four strong dwarfs who stood
east and west and south and north with the great
weight resting on their shoulders. All this work
seemed good in the eyes of the gods, and they knew
that everything as it left their hands would prosper
if only the frost-giants would stay in J&ouml;tunheim&mdash;their
dreary, fog-wrapped country that lay beyond
the ocean which now encircled the earth.</p>

</div>

<p>To the giantess Night, and her son, Day, the gods
gave chariots and swift horses, so that they might
drive through the sky every twenty-four hours.
Night had a dark chariot drawn by the black horse
Hrimfaxe (Frosty-mane), who rushed so swiftly
through the heavens that drops fell from his sweating
flanks and bit, and these became dew or hoar-frost
as they lighted on the earth. Day drove a
white horse which was called Skinfaxe (Shining-mane);
and when the chariot of his dusky mother
sank out of sight behind the hills, he harnessed his
shining steed and followed in the same path she had
chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
Beside the chariots which belonged to Night and
Day, the gods set two others in the heavens to light
the newly made earth. From the flames that leaped
forever out of the Land of Fire they made the sun
and moon, and placed each one in a golden chariot
so that they might be driven through the sky. The
horses which drew the sun and moon were beautiful
white creatures with shining golden manes. In order
that the restive steeds of the sun should not be
scorched by its fierce heat, the gods placed a great
shield in front of the chariot to protect the animals&rsquo;
flowing manes. The moon horses did not need
anything to stand between them and its mild rays.</p>

<p>Then Odin chose Mani and Sol&mdash;the son and
daughter of a giantess&mdash;to drive the chariots of
the sun and moon; and the story goes that many,
many years later, when there were people on the
earth, Mani looked out of his golden chariot one night
and saw two little children&mdash;a boy and a girl&mdash;carrying
between them a heavy pail of water.
These children were the servants of a cruel giant
who made them work all night instead of sleeping;
and Mani, feeling very sorry for them, and being
rather lonely all by himself, put out a long arm and
caught up the children from the earth. Then he set
them beside him in the moon; and they have remained
there with Mani ever since.</p>

<p>The frost-giants, who loved dreariness and gloom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
were very angry when they saw how bright the
world was with the light of the sun and moon; so
they sent two fierce gray wolves to follow close upon
the track of the bright chariots. Sometimes they
came so near that their great black shadows dimmed
the brightness of the sun, and sometimes they hung
so close to the wheels of the moon-car that its light
never reached the earth. The wolves never succeeded,
however, in eating up the chariots, though
their grim shapes often lingered threateningly in the
sky.</p>

<p>When the gods had formed the earth&mdash;which they
called Midgard&mdash;they chose the most beautiful spot
they could find for their home. In the very centre
of the earth rose a lofty mountain, and on the top
of it was a broad, lovely meadow where the gods
built their shining city of Asgard. In the midst
of the city was a spacious hall, made of gold and the
purest marble, and here were the thrones where the
gods sat when in council.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Beyond the hall were the
palaces of the gods<a name="FNanchor_5a_5a" id="FNanchor_5a_5a"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5A]</a> and goddesses,<a name="FNanchor_5b_5b" id="FNanchor_5b_5b"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5B]</a> also made of
marble and silver or gold, and near by was a huge
smithy where the gods forged the weapons needed
to defend their city from their enemies the frost-giants.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_4_4">[4]</a></span> This hall was called Gladsheim, and the palace of the goddesses

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
From Asgard to Midgard the gods stretched a
rainbow bridge which they called Bifrost; and over
this they passed and repassed on their frequent
journeys to the earth. There was no human being
on the earth at this time, and the gods felt sorry
that no eyes but their own could look upon the fruitful,
blossoming land. No one ploughed the fields or
built houses, or sailed in ships across the seas. No
voices of children rang over the meadows; no sound
of the reaper&rsquo;s scythe broke the stillness of the fields;
and no ringing of metal on the smith&rsquo;s firm anvil
was heard throughout the silent earth.</p>

<p>Then the gods took some of the earth-mould and
made of it a host of tiny creatures which they called
Dwarfs or Gnomes<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; but when Odin saw how ugly
they were, with their misshapen bodies and great
heads, he condemned them to live underground
and never to come up into the light of day. So the
dwarfs spent their time delving into the heart of the
earth for gold and silver and precious stones; and
they became the cleverest workmen at their tiny
forges, making wonderful things of every kind of
metal. They were cunning, too, and kept their
secrets well, so that neither gods nor men knew the
hiding-place of their treasures.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_6">[6]</a></span>
Sometimes also called Trolls. <a href="#FNanchor_6_6">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Besides the dwarfs, the gods made the Fairies,&mdash;or
Elves,&mdash;but these were so airily and daintily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
fashioned that they seemed to belong to the sky
instead of the earth. So the gods built the fairy
folk a home between Midgard and Asgard&mdash;a
beautiful place called Elfland, all made of rainbow
colours and moonbeams, and gossamer silks and
delicate spiders&rsquo; webs. The gods also gave these
little people gauzy wings so that they could fly down
to earth and play with the butterflies, and make caps
of harebells, and dance in the moonlight round a
fairy ring. They were never wicked and spiteful
like the Gnomes, though they sometimes liked to
play good-natured tricks on stupid people; and
fortunate indeed was the child or man who won a
fairy for his friend.</p>

<p>One day Odin and H&oelig;nir and Loki were walking
about on the earth; and as they drew near to the seashore
they saw two stately trees, an ash and an elm,
standing side by side. Then Odin took the trees,
and out of them he made two living beings that
resembled the gods themselves in form and feature.
H&oelig;nir touched their foreheads, that they might have
sight and wisdom, and Loki gave them warm blood,
with the power to speak and hear and feel. Thus
man and woman were created; and the gods called
the man Ask, and the woman Embla, from the
names of the trees from which they were made.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>Odin&rsquo;s Search for Wisdom</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T the end of the rainbow bridge stood the
wonderful tree Ygdrasil, which bound all
the worlds together in the grasp of its
mighty hands. Some of the roots were firmly fixed
in Midgard, and even extended underground to the
home of the swarthy elves. Some roots branched
out into J&ouml;tunheim, where the frost-giants ever
strove to tear them out; and one root struck down
into the very depths of the earth, to that dark region
of the dead where ruled the terrible goddess Hel.
The Tree of Life also grew upwards to a marvellous
height, and its branches spread out so widely that
many birds and beasts came to it for shelter. The
topmost boughs reached up to Asgard, where they
overshadowed Odin&rsquo;s hall.</p>

<p>At the foot of the tree Ygdrasil sat the three
Norns&mdash;or Fates<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;who weave the thread of
each man&rsquo;s life. Every day the Norns sprinkled the
tree with water from the sacred Urdar fountain; so
the tree always flourished, and its leaves kept fresh
and green in spite of the dragon<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which forever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
gnawed at its roots, hoping to destroy it. The
heavy foliage that crowned its upper boughs never
lacked for moisture, but grew more beautiful each
year, although Heidrun, the goat of Odin, browsed
on its leaves, and though it furnished food to four
great stags who grazed beside it. From the horns
of these stags dew continually fell in such abundance
that it supplied water for all the rivers of the earth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a></span>
The dragon&rsquo;s name was Nidhogg. <a href="#FNanchor_8_8">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The very topmost branch of the Tree of Life was
called the Peace Bough, and on it sat a great eagle who
kept watch over all that happened in the worlds below.
Up and down the trunk of the mighty Ygdrasil
scampered the squirrel Ratatosk, a mischievous little
fellow who delighted to make trouble between the
eagle and the dragon at the foot of the tree by repeating
malicious speeches which he said each had made
of the other. In this way he hoped to stir up such
strife that he would some day see a terrible battle
fought between them. Ratatosk was daring enough
to explore all the land that was overshadowed by
the boughs of Ygdrasil, but he never ventured near
the gates of Asgard, nor did he risk going into the
deep grove that sheltered Mimer&rsquo;s well&mdash;that wonderful
well whose waters flowed down into the roots
of the Tree of Life.</p>

<p>The Peace Bough hung over the hall of the gods
just above the golden throne where Odin sat ruling
the affairs of gods and men. On Odin&rsquo;s head was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
shining helmet shaped like an eagle, and over his
shoulders was thrown a mantle of deep blue with such
a wonderfully jewelled hem that it looked as if the
cloak were edged with stars. In his hand he held a
spear which was deemed so sacred that if any one
swore an oath upon its point, he would never dare
to break it. At Odin&rsquo;s feet crouched two great
wolves<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which he fed daily with his own hand; and
on his shoulders perched his two ravens Hugin and
Munin (Thought and Memory) who flew each
morning over the earth and brought back to Odin
the news of all that was going on in the earth below.
Sometimes they told him of the brave deeds of
heroes; sometimes they spoke of the swarthy elves,
or of the frost-giants plotting vengeance in their
home beyond the frozen seas; and sometimes they
warned him that the Midgard serpent, who lay with
his immense body encircling the earth, was lashing
the sea into foam with his tail and rolling up the
waves until they threatened to cover the earth.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_9_9">[9]</a></span>
Their names were Geri and Freki. <a href="#FNanchor_9_9">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Since the ruling of the world was in Odin&rsquo;s hands,
he was anxious to gain wisdom enough for this great
task; and though the gods far excelled the earth-folk
in knowledge, there were some of the frost-giants
who were wiser than Odin, for they knew of things
that happened long before the coming of the gods.
On this account the dwellers in Asgard were ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
fearful lest their enemies should destroy their shining
city; and Odin longed for the knowledge that would
make him greater than any one in all the worlds.</p>

<p>There was only one way to get such wisdom as
Odin wanted, and that was to drink deep of the water
that flowed into Mimer&rsquo;s well. No one save the
hoary old giant himself had ever tasted the water of
the Well of Wisdom; but Odin knew that without it
he could never learn of things past and present and to
come. So he laid aside his spear and helmet; and
mounting his eight-legged horse Sleipnir, rode over
the rainbow bridge to the deep grove of trees in the
heart of which old Mimer sat guarding his sacred
well.</p>

<p>Leaving Sleipnir some distance behind, Odin
advanced alone; and soon came in sight of the giant
seated like a stone image beside the Well of Wisdom.
Mimer was so very, very old that he looked as if he
had sat there ever since the beginning of time; and
as Odin stood in the dimly lighted grove, he seemed
to be the only living thing in all that vast stillness.
The giant&rsquo;s hair was white, and his beard had
grown so long that it reached almost to the ground as
he leaned forward with his head resting on his hand.
In the other hand he held an ivory horn; but though
many had passed by the sacred well, no god or mortal
had ever been given a drink from Mimer&rsquo;s horn.</p>

<p>Odin advanced slowly to the giant&rsquo;s side; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
old man, who had sat for ages and ages looking down
into the clear depths of the water, now raised his eyes
and fixed them, not unkindly, on the waiting god.
Great and wise as Odin was, being ruler of gods and
men, he felt a strange awe in the presence of this
hoary old Mimer, who lived long before the creation
of the worlds and was living before the gods and the
frost-giants engaged in their terrible warfare. As
Odin approached the sacred well, Mimer was fully
aware of who his visitor was, for he knew all things
that ever had been, or are, or were yet to be. His
eyes, so keen and piercing, looked kindly upon the
god from beneath his shaggy brows; and his voice
sounded soft to Odin&rsquo;s ears as he said slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does the All-Father seek so far from sunny
Asgard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to beg a draught from your well, O
Mimer,&rdquo; answered Odin.</p>

<p>The old giant&rsquo;s face grew grave. &ldquo;Whoever asks
for that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;must be willing to give much
in return. Many desire to drink of the waters of
wisdom, but few will pay the price. What will you
give in return for a draught from Mimer&rsquo;s well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only a moment did Odin hesitate; then he said
boldly, &ldquo;I will give anything you ask.&rdquo; At these
words Mimer handed him the ivory horn, saying:
&ldquo;Drink, then; and the wisdom of the ages shall be
yours. But before you go hence, leave with me as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
pledge one of your eyes.&rdquo; So Odin drank deep of the
well of wisdom; and thereafter no one in all the
worlds was able to compare with the Father of the
Gods in wisdom. None of the dwellers in Asgard
ever questioned Odin concerning his visit to Mimer&rsquo;s
well; but they honoured him more deeply for the
great sacrifice he had made; and whenever Odin
visited the earth to mingle in the affairs of men,
people knew him as the god who had but a single
eye.</p>

<p>There was one other person besides old Mimer who
was reputed to have greater wisdom than the gods,
and this was the frost-giant Vafthrudner. Now
Odin was very anxious to measure his knowledge with
that of his old enemy, for if the frost-giants were no
longer wiser than the wisest of the gods, there was
less need to fear them. To put his wisdom to the
test, Odin set out on the long, dreary journey to
J&ouml;tunheim; and soon he found Vafthrudner sitting
at the door of his snow-house. When the giant saw
a visitor approaching, he stopped shaking the icicles
from his frozen beard, and stared hard at the intruder.
Odin had disguised himself as a traveller,
so Vafthrudner did not know him and thought he
was another foolish adventurer who had come to
learn wisdom at the cost of his life. For the penalty
which the loser must pay in his strife with the
giant&rsquo;s wisdom was death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
So Vafthrudner laughed until the mountains
shook when Odin declared that this was the object of
his journey to J&ouml;tunheim; for it amused the giant
vastly to think that a mere man had come to contend
with him in wisdom. He bade the stranger sit
down, and Odin obeyed, pulling his slouched hat
well over his eye, so that the giant might not guess
who his visitor was. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Vafthrudner,
&ldquo;the name of the river that divides Asgard from
J&ouml;tunheim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The river Ifing, where the waters are never
frozen,&rdquo; replied Odin, quickly. The frost-giant
looked surprised, but he only said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have answered rightly, O Wise One. And
now tell me the names of the horses that draw the
chariots of Night and Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skinfaxe and Hrimfaxe,&rdquo; promptly replied Odin.
Vafthrudner turned and looked hard at this remarkable
stranger who could speak so readily of
things that no man was thought to know. Then
he asked many more questions, to which Odin gave
unhesitatingly the right answers; and soon the frost-giant
began to feel afraid of the strange traveller
who seemed to know more than the gods themselves.
Anxiously he put the last question, saying,
&ldquo;Tell me, O Great One, the name of the plain on
which the Last Battle will be fought.&rdquo; Now Vafthrudner
knew that no mortal man could possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
answer this question, so he waited fearfully for Odin&rsquo;s
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the plain of Vigrid, which is a hundred miles
on each side,&rdquo; came the answer; and at this the
frost-giant began to quake with fear, for his boasted
wisdom had been fairly met, and at last some one
had come to J&ouml;tunheim to defeat him.</p>

<p>Now it was Odin&rsquo;s turn to ask questions; and he
drew from this wisest of the giants a knowledge of
things that happened long before the gods came to
dwell in Asgard. He learned all the secrets that
the giants guarded so carefully; and he made Vafthrudner
tell him of the dim unknown future, and of
the events that would shape the lives of gods and
men. So eager was Odin to gain the desired wisdom
that he forgot how long he had been sitting at
the frost-giant&rsquo;s side and listening while Vafthrudner
told him of the time when no gods were living, and
of the time when no gods should be.</p>

<p>The long day waned, and the curious stars peeped
out, and Mani&mdash;as he drove his horses over the
western hills&mdash;wondered why Odin lingered so
long in dreary J&ouml;tunheim. When the All-Father
had learned all he desired to know, he rose up and
said: &ldquo;One last question I will put, O Vafthrudner;
and by its answer we may judge which is the wiser
of us two. What did Odin whisper in the ear of
Balder as that shining one lay on the funeral pyre?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
When the frost-giant heard this question he knew at
last who it was that had been contending with him,
and he answered humbly: &ldquo;Who but thyself, O
Odin, can tell the words which thou didst say to thy
son? Thou art truly the wisest of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Odin departed on the long journey back to
Asgard, and the gods rejoiced at his return, for
hitherto no one had ever been known to strive with
Vafthrudner and live.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>The Story of the Magic Mead</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE once lived on the earth a man named
Kvasir; and he was much beloved by the
gods because they had given him the
wonderful gift of poetry. Kvasir was a great
traveller, and wherever he went men begged him to
tell them, in his singing words, of the life of the gods
and of the brave deeds of heroes. So the poet
went from cottage to castle sharing his gift with rich
and poor alike. Sometimes he told the familiar tales
that had grown old on men&rsquo;s lips; and sometimes
he sang of heroes in far-off forgotten lands.</p>

<p>Every one loved Kvasir&mdash;every one except the
spiteful little dwarfs who grew jealous of him, and
longed to do him some evil. So one day when the
poet was walking on the seashore, two of the dwarfs
named Fialar and Galar came up to him and begged
him to visit their cave in the rocks. Now Kvasir
never suspected wrong of any one, so he willingly
followed the dwarfs into a dark cavern underground.
Here the treacherous brothers slew him, and drained
his blood into three jars in which they had already
placed some honey. Thus of sweetness mingled with
a poet&rsquo;s life-blood they brewed the Magic Mead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
which would give to any one who drank of it gentleness
and wisdom and the gift of poesy.</p>

<p>When the dwarfs had mixed the mead, they took
great care to hide it in a secret cave; and then, proud
of their cruel cunning, they set off in search of further
adventures. Soon they found the giant Gilling
asleep on the seashore; and after pinching him
awake, they asked him to row them a little way in
his boat. The giant, who was both good-natured
and stupid, took the dwarfs into his boat, and began
to row vigorously. Then Galar suddenly steered
the boat so that it struck on a sharp rock and was
overturned. The poor giant, who could not swim,
was immediately drowned; while the wicked little
dwarfs climbed upon the keel of the boat and finally
drifted ashore.</p>

<p>Not content with this cruel act, they went straightway
to the giant&rsquo;s house and called to his wife to
come quickly, for Gilling was drowning. The
giantess at once hurried to her husband&rsquo;s aid; and
as she came through the doorway, Fialar, who had
climbed up above the lintel, suddenly dropped a
millstone on her head, killing her instantly.</p>

<p>As the dwarfs were jumping up and down exulting
over their success, the giant&rsquo;s son&mdash;whose name
was Suttung&mdash;came along. When he saw his
mother stretched dead upon the ground, and the
little men skipping about in their wicked glee, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
guessed who was guilty of this shameful deed. So
he seized Galar and Fialar, one in each hand; and,
wading far out into the sea, he set them on a certain
rock which was sure to be covered with water when
the tide rose. As he turned to go away, the dwarfs
screamed to him in terror and begged him to take
them back to land. In their fright they promised
to give him anything he might ask if only he would
put them safe on shore.</p>

<p>Now Suttung had heard of the Magic Mead, and
he longed very much to possess it; so he made the
dwarfs promise to give him the three jars in exchange
for their lives. Much as Galar and Fialar hated to
do this, they had no choice but to agree to the giant&rsquo;s
demand; so as soon as they were on land again, they
delivered the precious mead into his hands. As
Suttung could not be at home all day to guard his
treasure, he hid the jars in a deep recess in the rocks,
and bade his daughter Gunlod watch over them
night and day. The mouth of the cavern was sealed
up with an enormous stone so that no one could enter
except by a passageway known only to Gunlod, and
Suttung felt that his treasure was safe from both
gods and men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the news of Kvasir&rsquo;s death had been
brought to Odin by his ravens Hugin and Munin,
and he determined to get possession of the wonderful
mead that had been brewed from the poet&rsquo;s blood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
So he disguised himself as a traveller, pulled his gray
hat well over his face and set out for the country
where the Magic Mead was hidden. As he neared
the giant&rsquo;s home, he saw a field in which nine sturdy
thralls<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> were mowing hay. These men did not
belong to Suttung, but were the servants of his
brother Baugi. This suited Odin&rsquo;s purpose just as
well, so he went quickly up to the thralls and said:
&ldquo;Your scythes seem very dull. How much faster
you could work if they were sharper. Shall I whet
them for you?&rdquo; The men were surprised at this
unexpected offer of help; but they accepted the
stranger&rsquo;s assistance gladly. When they found how
sharp he had made their scythes, they begged him to
sell or give them the marvellous whetstone. To this
Odin replied, &ldquo;Whoever can catch it, may have it
as a gift,&rdquo; and with these words he threw the stone
among them. Then began a fierce battle among
the thralls for the possession of the prize; and they
cut at each other so fiercely with their scythes
that by evening every one of them lay dead in the
field.</p>

Thralls; servants. <a href="#FNanchor_10_10">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>While they were fighting thus savagely, Odin
sought out Baugi&rsquo;s house and begged for supper and
a night&rsquo;s lodging. The giant received him hospitably;
and as they sat eating, word was brought to
Baugi that his nine thralls were dead. For a time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
Odin listened to his host&rsquo;s complaints of his evil luck
and of how much wealth he would lose through his
unmowed fields. Then he offered his services to
Baugi, promising to do as much work as the nine
thralls. The giant was very doubtful whether his
visitor could make good this boast; but he accepted
the offer quickly, and next morning Odin set to
work in the fields.</p>

<p>Before many days had passed, all the hay on
Baugi&rsquo;s land was carefully stored away in the barns,
and Odin came to the giant to demand his wages.
&ldquo;What payment shall I make you?&rdquo; asked Baugi,
fearing that a great sum would be named as the price
of such remarkable service. He was surprised,
therefore, when Odin answered, &ldquo;All I ask is a
draught of the Magic Mead which your brother
Suttung keeps hidden in a cavern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not an easy thing to get,&rdquo; replied the
giant, &ldquo;for though I would be glad to fetch you
some of the mead, my brother has never let me enter
the cave. However, I will ask him to bring you a
single draught.&rdquo; So Baugi went in search of his
brother, and told him of the wonderful service that
Odin had rendered. Then he asked for one drink
of the Magic Mead for his servant. At this Suttung
flew into a great rage and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would give any of the mead to a
stranger who can do the work of nine thralls? No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
<em>man</em> could have such wonderful power. It is a god
that you have been calling your servant, and the
gods have been our enemies since the beginning of
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Baugi feared and hated the gods as much as
his brother; but he had given his word to Odin to
help him get the Magic Mead, and he did not dare
to break his promise. So when he returned to his
one-time servant, and told of the ill success of his
visit to Suttung, Odin answered: &ldquo;Then we must
try some other way. Take me to the cavern where
the mead is hidden; but see that your brother knows
nothing of our going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very unwillingly Baugi consented to show Odin
the secret cave; and as they walked, he plotted how
to get rid of his troublesome servant. It seemed
to take the giant a very long time to find the cavern;
but when they finally reached it, Odin drew an augur
from his pocket, and began to bore a hole in the
great stone that stood at the cave&rsquo;s mouth. As
soon as he grew tired, he made Baugi take his turn
at the augur; and, owing to the giant&rsquo;s great
strength, a hole was soon bored through the rock.
Then Odin quickly turned himself into a snake and
crept into the opening while Baugi, seeing his servant
no longer beside him, and realizing what the
sudden transformation meant, made a stab at the
snake with the augur, hoping to kill it. But Odin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
had slid safely through the hole, and was already
inside the cave.</p>

<p>Taking his rightful form, Odin now began to look
eagerly about him, and when his eyes grew accustomed
to the dimness of the cavern, he saw the
daughter of Suttung seated in the furthest corner
beside the three jars that contained the Magic Mead.
He came softly to Gunlod&rsquo;s side, and spoke to her so
gently that she was not frightened at the sudden
appearance of a stranger; and when he smiled at
her with a reassuring look, she asked, &ldquo;Who are you,
and why are you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a traveller, tired and thirsty after my long
journey,&rdquo; answered Odin. &ldquo;Will you not give me
something to drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunlod shook her head. &ldquo;I have nothing here
save the Magic Mead, and that I dare not give you,&rdquo;
she said sadly. Then Odin begged for just a single
draught, but the giant&rsquo;s daughter firmly refused to
let him touch the jars.</p>

<p>At last, after much coaxing and soft words, Gunlod
allowed her visitor to take one sip of the mead;
but as soon as Odin got the jars in his hands, he
drained each one dry before the astonished maiden
had realized what had happened. Then he changed
himself quickly into a snake, and glided out through
the opening in the rock. It was now but a moment&rsquo;s
work to assume an eagle&rsquo;s form, and start at once on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
his journey back to Asgard. He knew well that there
was no time to lose, for Baugi had already gone to his
brother with the news of what had happened at the
cave&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>When Suttung heard Baugi&rsquo;s story and realized
that his precious mead was being stolen by one of
the gods, he hurried at once to the cavern. Just
as he reached it, he saw an eagle rise heavily up from
the earth, and he knew this was some god in disguise
bearing away the Magic Mead to Asgard. So he
quickly changed himself into an eagle, and started
in pursuit of the one with slowly moving wings.
Odin could not fly very fast, for the mead made him
heavy; and he was much distressed to see that the
giant was easily gaining on him. As they both
neared the gates of Asgard, some of the gods were
looking out, and they saw the two birds approaching.
They wondered what the pursuit might mean; but
it was not until the eagles neared the outer walls
that the watchers realized that it was Odin fleeing
from an enemy, and straining his weary wings to
reach Asgard.</p>

<p>Then they laid a great pile of wood on the inner
walls, and to this they applied a torch the moment
that the first eagle had passed safely over. The
flames shot up with a roar just as the pursuer had
almost caught his prey. The fire scorched Baugi&rsquo;s
great wings, and the smoke blinded his eyes so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
he fluttered helplessly down to the earth. Meanwhile
the Magic Mead was safe in Asgard, and there
it was put in care of Bragi, the white-haired son of
Odin. Thus the mead remained forever with the
gods; but sometimes a favoured mortal is given, at
his birth, a drop of this divine drink; and then, in
later years, men find that a poet has been born
among them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>EAR Odin&rsquo;s council hall was a fair white building
called the Hall of Mists,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and here sat
Frigga,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the wife of Odin, spinning the many-coloured
clouds. She spent long hours beside her
golden wheel; and when she spun by day, the clouds
were white and soft and fleecy; but toward evening
Frigga put a touch of colour into her work, and then
the heavens glowed with yellow and violet and red.
It was through Odin&rsquo;s careful wife that snow fell
plentifully in winter, for then Frigga shook her
feather beds, and made them ready for the touch of
the spring sunshine. At her command the rain fell
all through the year, so that the streets of Asgard
might always be kept spotless. It was Frigga, too,
who made the wonderful gift of flax to men; and
she taught the women how to spin and weave.</p>

</div>

<p>Frigga was very fond of children; and one day,
as she looked down upon the earth, she saw two little
boys playing together on the seashore. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
Geirrod and Agnar, sons of a wealthy king<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; and
Frigga grew to love them very dearly. She was so
anxious to talk to them and know them, that she
persuaded Odin to go with her down to the earth;
and, having disguised themselves as an old fisherman
and his wife, they took possession of a deserted hut.
This hut was on an island many miles from the country
where Geirrod and Agnar lived; but Odin promised
Frigga that in spite of this, the children would
come to her.</p>

<div class="footnote">

King Hraudung. <a href="#FNanchor_13_13">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>One day Geirrod and his brother went out rowing
in their boat, and a storm came up which blew the
tiny craft far out to sea. The boys became terribly
frightened; and the wind tossed them about on the
angry waves until they would surely have perished
if Odin had not been watching over them. He kept
their frail boat from sinking, and guided it to the
very shore on which he and Frigga were living in
the little hut. The boys were glad indeed when
their feet once more touched the solid earth; for
they were tired and hungry and cold, and a good deal
frightened, too. They knew that they must be far
from their own country; but they were so glad to
be out of reach of the waves that it mattered little
to them what land it was to which the wind had
brought them.</p>

<p>When they began to look about them, they found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
that the island was very bleak and bare, with no
flowers nor fruits nor berries to be seen anywhere.
Nothing seemed to be growing there but low, thorny
bushes that scratched them and tore their clothes as
they attempted to make their way further into the
island. Soon it began to get dark, and the boys
stumbled helplessly through the briers; but at last
they saw the glimmer of a light, and groped their
way toward it. Presently they came to a small
hut, through whose open window the friendly light
was streaming, and, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
they knocked loudly at the door.</p>

<p>They were a bit surprised at the appearance of
the two people within the hut; for although they
were simply clad as peasants, there was something
in their bearing that reminded Geirrod and Agnar
of the lordly guests who had sat at their father&rsquo;s
table. But the boys were too hungry and tired to
pay much attention to the kind folk who took them
in, though they were grateful for the food and dry
clothing and a warm place by the fire. Some days
later, Geirrod inquired of his host how a fisherman
could afford such wonderfully soft beds and food fit
for kings to dine upon. Agnar asked no questions,
but wondered why the flowers bloomed so plentifully
around the cottage door, and why the birds
sang all day.</p>

<p>It was too stormy for the boys to attempt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
venture on the sea for many days; and even when
the storm was over, the waves looked dark and
menacing. Winter was coming on, and there was
little chance that the sea would grow calm; so Geirrod
and Agnar lingered day after day in the fisherman&rsquo;s
cottage, needing no persuasion to remain
with their new-found friends. Geirrod spent all
of his time with the fisherman,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> learning the lore of
the sea and becoming very adept in the use of the
spear as well as the humbler net and line. He was
also taught to hunt the game that was plentiful on
the island, and he grew very proud of his skill with
the bow. All day he stayed at the fisherman&rsquo;s
side, listening, learning and wondering at the great
knowledge which his companion had of things that
had happened before the world was made. He
heard many tales of heroes, and learned of brave
deeds that had been done by men of his own race.
He knew that the fisherman told these stories so
that he himself might see how fine a thing it was to
be brave and strong and noble; and Geirrod, who
was by nature selfish and cruel, felt so thrilled by
the old man&rsquo;s stirring words that he wished to be
like the heroes whose lives were so loudly praised.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_14_14">[14]</a></span>
The fisherman called himself Grimner. <a href="#FNanchor_14_14">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Agnar usually stayed with the fisherman&rsquo;s wife
in the cottage; for he was gentler and more timid
than his brother, and preferred to help his kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
foster-mother instead of hunting with Geirrod or
venturing out on the sea to spear the great fish.
Agnar, too, heard many stories as he sat by the goodwife&rsquo;s
side while she spun her flax; but these were
not hero-tales nor stories of adventure. She told
him how the god Freyr makes the flowers bloom,
and the fruits ripen; and how his sister Freya
watches over the earth all through the springtime.
She spoke of the love which these two had for all
the beautiful things in nature, for music and poetry,
and how they even watched with delight the dancing
of the fairies in Elfheim. She told him how wonderful
the city of Asgard looked when the sun shone on the
broad, golden streets; and how the sounds re&euml;choed
through the great hall called Valhalla where Odin
feasted with the heroes chosen from the battle-field.</p>

<p>So the winter passed quickly, and when spring
came the fisherman built a new, strong boat in
which the boys were to make their voyage homeward.
Then Geirrod and Agnar said good-by to the kind
folk with whom they had passed so many happy
days. Reluctantly they sailed away from the
friendly island, and soon came in sight of their own
country. A fair wind carried them gently all the
way, for Odin had commanded Njord, the storm
god, to keep his blusterous winds under control.
As the boat neared the familiar shores, Geirrod forgot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
all the generous lessons that the fisherman had
tried to teach him, and he began to look with hatred
at his brother. As Agnar was the older of the two,
he would inherit the kingdom; so Geirrod was filled
with a sudden rage against the gentle boy who stood
in the way of his becoming king.</p>

<p>As the boat drew toward the shore, Geirrod sprang
out, and giving the boat a mighty shove toward the
open sea he cried: &ldquo;Go back to the island, you weak,
timid girl. You are not fit to be king.&rdquo; Then,
being a sturdy swimmer, he made for the land. The
boat drifted out again to sea, and carried Agnar to
a strange land, where he lived many years. Finally
he returned to his own country in disguise and
became a servant in his father&rsquo;s palace&mdash;but by
this time Geirrod had already been made king. For
when Geirrod swam ashore, he hastened at once
to his father and told him the whole story of his
adventure with the fisherman on the island. When
the king asked for Agnar, Geirrod said that his
brother had been drowned on the journey home by
falling over the edge of the boat. As there was no
reason to doubt this story, the king mourned for
Agnar as one dead; and the younger brother was
acknowledged heir to the throne. Not many years
later, the king died and Geirrod was made ruler
over the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>When Odin and Frigga, who had long since left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
the island and returned to Asgard, learned what had
become of their favourites, Odin was very proud that
Geirrod had become a great king. Frigga grieved,
however, that the gentle Agnar had suffered through
his brother&rsquo;s treachery, and hated to see him serving
as a menial in Geirrod&rsquo;s hall. When Odin praised
his former pupil, she would say: &ldquo;He is a great
king, but a cruel man. No stranger would dare to
trust to his mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now as unkindness to a stranger was a very despicable
trait in those days, this taunt of Frigga&rsquo;s
roused Odin&rsquo;s wrath; and he determined to show
her that Geirrod was not the heartless king she declared
him to be. So he disguised himself as an
aged traveller, and presented himself at Geirrod&rsquo;s
palace asking for food and shelter. Frigga, however,
was equally determined to prove Geirrod&rsquo;s
cruelty, and thus defend her favourite, Agnar. So
she secretly sent a messenger to the king bidding
him beware of a strange old man who would come to
the palace claiming the rights of hospitality.</p>

<p>Odin was much surprised when he met with rough
usage at the hands of Geirrod&rsquo;s servants, not knowing
that the king had commanded them to seize
any aged traveller who might come to the palace.
He was not welcomed to the well-filled table as he
had expected, but was rudely dragged before the
king. Now Geirrod, believing that this was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
stranger of whom he had been warned to beware,
commanded the old man to tell his name and the
object of his visit. The traveller stood with bowed
head, refusing to speak; and this made the king
so angry that he threatened the old man with torture
and death if he did not answer.</p>

<p>As the stranger continued to keep silent, Geirrod
commanded his servants to chain him to a pillar
in the great hall and build on each side of him a hot
fire whose flames would torture without destroying
him. So they dragged the unresisting old man to
the pillar and bound him with chains too strong for
even the stoutest warrior to break. Then they
kindled fires on either side of him and stood off,
laughing and mocking at the trembling figure that
seemed to crouch in terror against the pillar.</p>

<p>For eight days and nights the fires were kept burning,
and during all this time the cruel king allowed
no meat or drink to be given to his prisoner. But
one night, when the watchers were drowsy with ale
and the heat of the fires, a servant stole softly into
the hall with a great drinking-horn in his hand.
This he carried to the old man, who appeared to
be in great suffering, and he smiled happily when he
saw the prisoner drain the cool drink to the last
drop. This servant was Agnar, the king&rsquo;s brother,
whom every one believed to be dead.</p>

<p>The next morning, Geirrod assembled all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
nobles in the great hall, and they began to make
merry over the prisoner&rsquo;s misery, asking him if he
would now speak and tell them who he was and from
whence he came. The old man shook his head, refusing
to speak; but suddenly, to the astonishment
of all, he began to sing. And as he sang, the listeners
grew strangely silent, while a nameless fear
seized the whole company as they saw no longer the
crouching figure by the pillar, but a tall commanding
form before whose awful majesty they shrank back
trembling and afraid. As the singing continued,
the power and sweetness of the music filled the echoing
halls; and when the song was over, the chains
fell suddenly from the prisoner&rsquo;s arms and he stood&mdash;a
terrible accusing power&mdash;before the eyes of
the terrified people. Geirrod as well as his nobles
knew now that a god had come among them; and
the king, fearing for his life, tried madly to defend
himself. He seized his sword and rushed blindly
at the tall form confronting him, forgetting&mdash;in his
terror&mdash;that no weapon could prevail against an
immortal. Blinded by his fury, he fell forward
upon his own sword, and in a moment lay dead at
Odin&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>Then the All-Father called to Agnar and bade him
take his rightful place on the throne which his
brother had usurped. The people gladly welcomed
a kindlier ruler; and Odin, having righted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
wrongs which Geirrod&rsquo;s cruelty had created, now
returned to Asgard to report to the anxious Frigga
that her favourite was at last made king.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>There was once a king named Gylfe who was
reputed to be the wisest ruler of his time. He kept
many learned men at his court; but he was eager
to gain more knowledge than all these sages could
command, and so sent far and wide for men skilled
in magic and those whose eyes could read the secrets
of the stars.</p>

<p>One day an old woman<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> came to Gylfe&rsquo;s palace
asking alms, and she was brought at once into the
presence of the king. Gylfe treated her with great
kindness, and while she sat at the king&rsquo;s table eating
of his own rich food, she turned to the monarch saying:
&ldquo;Never has the stranger met with such kindness
as this. What can I give you in return?&rdquo;
The guests who were feasting began to laugh merrily,
but the king answered, &ldquo;There is nothing that
I wish for except wisdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, listen,&rdquo; said
the strange old woman, and she began to tell the
king a story of the world as it was when it came fresh
from the hands of the gods. Then she spoke of the
frost-giants, the ancient enemies of the shining ones
of Asgard; and as the king listened, he seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
see how all things must have looked in that first
morning of the world.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_15_15">[15]</a></span>
Her name was Gefjun. <a href="#FNanchor_15_15">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>When the old woman finished speaking and turned
to leave the palace, Gylfe begged her to accept some
gift in return for her wonderful stories; and the
stranger, who was really a giantess, replied: &ldquo;I
will take as much land as four oxen can plough in a
day and a night.&rdquo; Now the frost-giants had been
envying the earth-folk many years, and they wished
to add more land to their country beyond the frozen
seas. So when Gylfe consented to the old woman&rsquo;s
strange request, she brought four immense oxen from
J&ouml;tunheim, and harnessed them to a huge plough.
Then the giantess cut such a deep furrow into the
earth that a great tract of land was torn away; and
this, being carried out to sea by the oxen, was borne
westward to J&ouml;tunheim. Thus Gylfe lost a large
part of his kingdom, but he felt that even that was
not too great a price to pay for the knowledge which
he had gained.</p>

<p>Having learned from the giantess how wise were
all the dwellers in Asgard, Gylfe determined to seek
the gods themselves; though he knew that in his
eager desire for more wisdom he was likely to meet
death at their hands for his presumption. So he set
out on the journey to Asgard; but he would surely
have never reached those sacred halls if Odin had
not guided his footsteps and led him to the rainbow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
bridge that reached up from Midgard to the city of
the gods. Here, at the end of Bifrost, he met Heimdall,
the watchman who stood all day and night
guarding the shining city from the approach of the
giants. Whenever a stranger appeared at the
rainbow bridge he sounded his horn<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to warn the gods
of possible danger. Heimdall never slept; and he
not only saw as well by night as by day, but his
eyes had the wonderful power of seeing a hundred
miles all around. He also had such remarkable
ears that he could hear the grass growing, and tell
whether the wind was blowing on the sea.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_16_16">[16]</a></span>
Heimdall&rsquo;s horn was called the Gialar-horn. At Balder&rsquo;s
funeral, Heimdall rode to the sea on his horse Gulltopp. <a href="#FNanchor_16_16">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Having received a command from Odin to let
the stranger pass, Heimdall allowed the king to enter
the sacred city; and Gylfe soon found himself in
the presence of Odin. The Father of the Gods received
him kindly; and, after learning the object
of his journey, permitted Gylfe to seat himself in
the great council-hall. Then Odin asked the king
what it was he wished to know, and Gylfe began to
question him freely and fearlessly. He asked about
the creation of the world, about the seasons and the
rainfalls, and the changes of the moon. He asked
why the elves kept themselves forever hidden in the
earth, and why the fairies danced only in the moonlight.
He spoke, though timidly, of the dark underworld,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
and asked why the dead never came back to
earth again. He even questioned Odin concerning
the gods themselves; and to all these eager
queries, the All-Father gave a willing answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hall grew full of mist and shadows,
and Gylfe could hardly see the foot of Odin&rsquo;s throne.
A great noise like some deafening thunder shook the
council-hall, and the king, bewildered and frightened,
did not know where to turn for safety. Then
all at once the darkness and the sounds vanished,
and Gylfe found himself on a broad plain. At first
he thought that he had seen the shield-hung hall
and the shining streets of Asgard only in a dream;
but soon the words of Odin came back to him, and
he knew that he had indeed talked with the greatest
of the gods.</p>

<p>So Gylfe became the wisest ruler on the earth;
but though all men honoured him for his great wisdom,
many refused to believe that he had really
been within the gates of Asgard.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>Sif&rsquo;s Golden Hair and the Making
of the Hammer</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MONG the gods there was one who was really
unfit to be a god and to live in the shining
city of Asgard. He was the cause of much
trouble and mischief in his frequent journeys to the
earth, and he brought evil upon even the gods themselves.
But as Loki was the brother of Odin, he
could not very well be banished from Asgard, so the
gods endured his presence as best they could. Loki
did many unkind things that the gods never heard
of; but once he met with just punishment for his
meanness. This was the time that he robbed Sif
of her golden hair.</p>

<p>Sif was the wife of Thor<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the god of thunder.
She had beautiful long hair that fell over her
shoulders like a shower of gold, and of this she was
very proud. One day Sif fell asleep on the steps
of Thor&rsquo;s palace,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and while she lay there sleeping
Loki came walking by. There was nothing so dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
to Loki as a chance to do mischief, and he never saw
anything beautiful without wishing to spoil it; so
when he found Sif fast asleep, he stole up softly
behind her and cut off all her golden hair.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_17_17">[17]</a></span>
From Thor&rsquo;s day comes our word Thursday. <a href="#FNanchor_17_17">Back</a></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_18_18">[18]</a></span>
The palace was named Bilskirner. <a href="#FNanchor_18_18">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>When Sif woke at last and saw what had happened,
she began to cry bitterly, for her golden hair
was the pride and joy of Thor, and she was afraid
that he would never want to look at her again now
that it was gone. So she got up from the steps where
she was sitting, and went away to hide in the garden.
When Thor came home, he looked for her all through
the palace, and went from room to room calling her
name. Not finding her in the house, he went out
into the garden, and after searching for a long time
finally found poor Sif behind a stone, sobbing
bitterly. When he heard her story, he tried to
comfort her the best he could, but Sif continued
weeping and covered her shorn head with her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know who did this shameful thing,&rdquo; cried
Thor, wrathfully; &ldquo;it was that mischief-maker
Loki, but this time he shall pay dearly for his wickedness.&rdquo;
And he strode out of the palace with a look
so threatening that even the gods might have
trembled before him. Now Loki was not expecting
to be caught so soon, and he had not thought of
seeking a hiding place; so when Thor came suddenly
upon him he was too frightened to try to escape.
He even forgot his ready lies, and when Thor shook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
him angrily and threatened to kill him for his wicked
act, he made no denial, only begged for mercy and
promised to restore to Sif the hair he had cut off.
Thor therefore released him, after binding him by a
solemn oath to fulfil his promise.</p>

<p>The real hair which Loki had cut off he had already
lost, so to keep his word to Thor he must find
something else which would resemble it closely
enough to make Sif believe she had indeed her own
hair again. As there was only one place where
skilful and cunning work like this could be done,
Loki crossed the rainbow bridge that spans the gulf
between Asgard and the earth, and hurried to the
tall mountain which hides, amid its rocks, the entrance
to the lower world. No one but a god, or
one of the swarthy elves themselves, could have
found this hidden opening, but Loki knew it well.
He first looked for a tiny stream which flowed along
at the foot of the mountain. This he followed to
its source in a deep cave among the rocks, and when
he came to the spot where it bubbled up from the
ground, he raised a huge log that was lying, apparently
by chance, close beside it. This disclosed
a small passage leading down into the very centre
of the earth, and along this path Loki hastened,
often stumbling about in the darkness, until he came
to the underworld where lived the swarthy elves.
They were busily engaged in their wonderful workshop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
which was lighted only by the fires from the
forge, but when they saw Loki they laid down their
tools and asked him how they could serve him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a task,&rdquo; answered Loki, &ldquo;which requires
such great skill to perform that I hardly dare ask
you to attempt it. It is nothing less than for you to
make of your gold some locks of hair that will be
as soft and fine and beautiful as the golden hair
which adorns the head of Sif, the wife of Thor. You
have heard, no doubt, of its beauty, so you know how
difficult a task I have given you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elves, nothing daunted, set at once to work,
and selecting a bar of perfect gold, they pounded
it very soft, then spun it into threads so fine that
they looked like sunbeams, and so soft that they
felt like silk. When the work was finished and
placed in Loki&rsquo;s hand, it exceeded in beauty anything
he had ever seen, and he felt sure that Thor
could not complain of his gift. Then he thanked
the swarthy elves and hastened with his prize back
to Asgard and to the palace of Thor, where all the
gods had assembled to see the fulfilment of Loki&rsquo;s
promise.</p>

<p>In spite of the success of his undertaking, the fear
of Thor&rsquo;s hasty temper kept Loki somewhat humbled,
for the Thunderer had been known to crush the
object of his anger with his hammer when once his
wrath was fully roused. His face was now dark and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
threatening as Loki approached, and beside him
stood Sif, weeping bitterly, and trying to cover her
head with her hands. But Loki came up boldly
and placed the golden hair which the elves had made,
upon her head. To the astonishment of all, it immediately
grew fast, and no one could have told that
it was not her own golden hair. So Sif was proud
and happy once again, and Loki was forgiven.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Loki went to the underground home of the
elves to find the golden hair for Sif, he thought that
it would be as well to get two other gifts&mdash;one for
Odin and one for Freyr&mdash;so that their anger would
fall less heavily on him for his cruelty to Thor&rsquo;s
beautiful wife. The dwarfs were always very glad
to help Loki when he was in trouble, for they, too,
delighted in mischief-making; so when he asked them
for the two other gifts, they gladly set to work. The
spun-gold hair they had already placed in Loki&rsquo;s
hands; and now they hurried about, getting together
a hundred different materials to use in their work&mdash;for
things of earth, air, fire and water went into the
making of the wonderful gifts that came from the
hands of the elves.</p>

<p>In a short time they handed to the waiting god
a spear<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that would always hit the mark no matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
how badly it was thrown, and a marvellous boat<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
that would fold up into a tiny package, but could
also expand large enough to hold all the gods and
goddesses in Asgard. Loki was delighted with
these gifts and hurried with them back to Odin&rsquo;s
council-hall where the gods had assembled to pass
judgment on him for his cruel treatment of Sif.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_19_19">[19]</a></span>
The spear was named Gunger. <a href="#FNanchor_19_19">Back</a></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_20_20">[20]</a></span>
The boat was named Skidbladner. <a href="#FNanchor_20_20">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Though the hair of spun gold proved to be so perfect
that Loki had nothing to fear from Thor&rsquo;s
anger, he saw that Odin was still displeased and was
looking at him with stern brows. So the wily god
produced his two other gifts, and handed the spear
to Odin and the boat to Freyr. Both the gods were
delighted with the clever workmanship of the elves;
and all the company were so busy examining Loki&rsquo;s
gifts that they did not notice the dwarf Brock, who
had followed Loki to Asgard and was now standing
in the shadow of Odin&rsquo;s throne.</p>

<p>When the gods grew loud in their approval of the
magic spear and boat, Brock could contain his anger
no longer and cried out: &ldquo;Can you find nothing
better than those petty toys to praise? My brother
Sindri can make far more wonderful things than
these.&rdquo; At this boastful interference Loki grew
very angry and said: &ldquo;Prove it, then; for I know
that your brother is only a stupid workman. Let
us make a wager that you cannot bring here three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
gifts better than those you scorn; and whichever of
us loses in the contest shall pay for it with his head.&rdquo;
Brock accepted the challenge and set off at once to
the cave where Sindri kept his dwarfs at work night
and day.</p>

<p>He told his brother of the wager he had made with
Loki, and Sindri laughed and promised that the
god&rsquo;s head should hang that night in the cave as a
trophy. Then he made ready a huge fire, and as he
worked busily over his tools he bade Brock keep the
bellows going as hard as he could so that the flames
would leap higher and higher. Then, when he
thought the right moment had come, he threw into
the fire a pigskin; and bidding Brock keep steadily at
work on the bellows, he left the cave.</p>

<p>The dwarf blew hard at the fire, and the forge
gleamed so brightly that the whole cave was lit up,
and Brock could see the piles of gold and silver
and glittering gems that lay all around. Then
suddenly an enormous gadfly flew into the room;
and, lighting on his hand, stung him so badly that
he roared with pain. Still he did not take his hand
from the bellows, for, with the cunning of his race, he
knew that the gadfly was none other than Loki who
had taken this form, hoping to spoil Sindri&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>When the master-smith returned, he looked eagerly
at the forge and saw that the fire glowed as brightly
as ever. So he muttered a few magic words over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
the flames and drew forth a golden boar. This he
handed to his brother, saying that the boar had the
power to fly through the air, and shed light from his
golden bristles as he flew. Brock was so much
pleased with this gift that he said nothing about his
swollen hand; and when Sindri asked him to keep
his place at the bellows, he willingly agreed.</p>

<p>The smith then threw a lump of gold into the
flames; and bidding Brock keep the fire at white
heat, he again left the cave. Brock began to work
harder than ever at the bellows; and as the fire
glowed so that it seemed like daylight in the room,
the gadfly flew at him and stung him on the neck.
He screamed with pain and tried to shake off his
tormentor, but still he kept faithfully at his work
and never lifted his hand a moment from the bellows.
When Sindri returned, he found the fire glowing
brightly, and, leaning over it, he pulled out of the
flames a fine gold ring, which every ninth night would
drop nine gold rings as wonderful as itself.</p>

<p>Brock was so delighted with this gift that he almost
forgot about his wounded neck; and obediently
kept his place at the bellows. Then Sindri threw a
lump of iron into the fire, and bidding his brother
work steadily at his task&mdash;for this was the most
important gift of all&mdash;he went out of the cave.
Brock grasped the bellows firmly, and began to work
with all his might. Just as the flames were leaping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
fiercely and the room seemed lit by a million candles,
the gadfly flew at Brock and stung him between the
eyes.</p>

<p>The poor little dwarf was almost frantic from the
pain of the wound and from the blood that poured
into his eyes. But though dazed and blinded so
that he could hardly see the fire, he kept doggedly
at work on the bellows, only lifting one hand for a
moment to wipe the blood from his eyes. The fire
had been glowing like a furnace, but in that one
instant the flames burned less brightly, and Sindri&mdash;who
had just entered the room&mdash;began to berate
his brother for his carelessness. Then the smith
drew out of the fire a mighty hammer, perfect in
every way except that the handle was too short,
owing to Brock&rsquo;s having lifted his hand a moment
from the bellows.</p>

<p>Sindri gave the three gifts to his brother, and
bade him hasten to Asgard, and bring back the head
of Loki as payment for the lost wager. When the
dwarf reached Odin&rsquo;s council-hall, the gods had assembled
to decide the contest, for every one was
eager to see what gifts Sindri had sent. Brock
handed the ring<a name="FNanchor_21a_21a" id="FNanchor_21a_21a"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21A]</a> to Odin, who praised it highly and
said, &ldquo;Now, I shall never want for gold.&rdquo; Freyr
was delighted with his gift of the golden boar<a name="FNanchor_21b_21b" id="FNanchor_21b_21b"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21B]</a> and
said that it would be much more entertaining to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
ride on its back than in Loki&rsquo;s magic boat. Lastly
Brock gave the wonderful hammer Mj&ouml;lner to Thor,
saying, &ldquo;Here is a hammer which can crush mountains,
can cause lightning and thunder when it swings
through the air, and will always come back to your
hand no matter how far you may throw it.&rdquo; Then
the dwarf turned to Odin and said, &ldquo;Decide now
between Loki and me, O Wise One, and declare whose
gifts are worth most to Asgard.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_21a_21a">[21A]</a>, <a href="#FNanchor_21b_21b">[21B]</a></span>
The ring was called Draupner, and the boar Gullinbursti. <a href="#FNanchor_21a_21a">Back to 21A</a>, <a href="#FNanchor_21b_21b">Back to 21B</a></p>
</div>

<p>Though the gods were reluctant to condemn one
of their number in favour of a dwarf, there was no
disputing the fact that Thor&rsquo;s hammer was worth
more than all of Loki&rsquo;s gifts, for it meant a sure
protection to Asgard from the attacks of the frost-giants.
So Odin declared that Brock had won the
wager, and that Loki must pay the forfeit with his
head. Now Loki had no intention of submitting to
this decree, so he first offered the dwarf a huge sum
of money as a ransom; but Brock angrily refused the
gold, and insisted that the bargain should be kept.
Then Loki cried out, &ldquo;Well, you must catch me
first,&rdquo; and sped off on his magic shoes, which could
carry him through the air and over the water with
wonderful swiftness. As Brock knew he could
never catch the fugitive, he grew black with rage,
and turned upon Odin, crying, &ldquo;Is this the way
that the gods keep faith, or shall the word of Odin
stand fast?&rdquo; Now all the company knew well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
that a promise made by even the meanest among
them must be held sacred; so Odin sent Thor after
Loki. In his swift chariot, drawn by the snow-white
goats, the Thunderer easily overtook the runaway
and brought him back to Asgard. Then Loki saw
that he must save his life by cunning, and he said
to Brock, &ldquo;You may take my head if you wish,
but you must not touch my neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now as this was obviously impossible, the dwarf
knew that he was outwitted by the crafty Loki, so
he went away fuming with rage and disappointment.
But before he left Asgard, he took out of his pocket
an awl and a thong, and sewed Loki&rsquo;s lips together
so that, for a while at least, the tricky god could
not do any more boasting.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>The Binding of the Fenris Wolf</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the very beginning of time, when the gods first
made the world, there was joy and gladness not
only in Asgard but over all the earth; sin and
evil were unknown, and death had not yet come even
among men. So the gods were very happy&mdash;all except
Loki, who looked on with jealous eyes at the
gladness which he could not share; for he knew no
pleasure save in devising mischief. Not satisfied
with grudging others their happiness, he sought
some means to bring about trouble, but finding himself
too powerless to accomplish anything alone, he
married a fierce giantess<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and had three terrible
children&mdash;Hel, the Midgard serpent and the Fenris
wolf.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_22_22">[22]</a></span>
Her name was Angerbode. <a href="#FNanchor_22_22">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>These dreadful creatures soon grew very strong
and fearful to look upon; and Loki was not content
to keep them in the dark cave in J&ouml;tunheim with
their gruesome mother, but allowed them to roam
about the earth. Soon they wearied of the narrow
limits of the earth and found no longer any pleasure
in bringing terror and even death to many lands.
So Loki took them up to Asgard and begged the gods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
to let him keep them there. For a while all went
well, but soon the presence of Loki&rsquo;s children became
a menace to even the gods&rsquo; safety; and they
grew fearful of Hel&rsquo;s deadly eyes, and the serpent&rsquo;s
foaming mouth and Fenrer&rsquo;s cruel jaws.</p>

<p>So one day Odin rose up from his throne, stern and
wrathful, and cast Hel down into the centre of the
earth, to rule over the dark region of the dead. Then
he threw the Midgard serpent into the bottom of the
sea, where he grew larger and larger, until his huge
body encircled the whole earth. But before he
could banish Fenrer, Loki came forward and begged
that the wolf might be spared and allowed to remain,
promising the gods that he would see that it did no
harm. So Odin consented, though with doubt and
mistrust.</p>

<p>After a while the wolf became very large and fierce,
and nothing seemed to appease his savage hunger.
Only Tyr, the sword-god, dared feed him, and he
wandered about Asgard growing daily more hungry,
and more cruel and terrible to see. At length
Odin called the gods together in council and said to
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenrer is getting to be more of a menace to our
lives every day, and I no longer trust Loki&rsquo;s promise
to guard our safety. We must therefore find some
way to control the wolf, for we cannot kill him and
so stain our shining city with his blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
Then Thor proposed that they should bind Fenrer
with a strong chain which he himself would make;
and to this plan the gods gladly agreed. So all
that night and for many days to come the sound
of Thor&rsquo;s hammer could be heard throughout Asgard
as he forged the links of a massive chain that should
bind the Fenris wolf.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> When it was finished, the
gods assembled before Odin, Thor carrying the heavy
chain upon his shoulders, and Loki coming up
cautiously with Fenrer, who stalked boldly beside him.
No force could possibly be used with a creature so
strong and fierce, so the gods sought to gain their
end by flattery, praising the wolf&rsquo;s size and strength,
and daring him to match it against the strength of
the chain which Thor had made.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_23_23">[23]</a></span>
This chain was called Leding. <a href="#FNanchor_23_23">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now Fenrer knew far better than they how terribly
strong he had become, and therefore he willingly lay
down and let them fasten the chain around his great
body, and then secure it to a rock. When this was
done, the gods breathed more freely, for it seemed as if
they had nothing to fear from the wolf any longer;
but in a moment Fenrer rose, stretched his huge
limbs and shook himself once. As he did so, the
chain fell to pieces as easily as if it were made of
glass. The gods looked on in wonder and dismay,
and the wolf walked off with a low, threatening growl.
Even Odin was silent with fear, for it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
revealed to him in the runes that in the final overthrow
of Asgard, the Fenris wolf should bear a part.</p>

<p>Thor now came forward and begged permission
to try again at making another chain much larger
and stronger than the last. The forging of this
second chain took many days and nights, for Thor
tested every link to see that it was strong and sure.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
At last it was finished, and brought on the shoulders
of the strongest of the gods to the foot of Odin&rsquo;s
throne. Fenrer was again summoned, but when
he saw the chain, he refused to be bound. No flattery
or coaxing could move him, so the gods began
to taunt him, laughing at his boasted strength and
accusing him of cowardice. Apparently with great
reluctance, the wolf again allowed himself to be
bound; and when the chain was secured about his
shaggy body and fastened tightly to the ground,
the gods looked on, feeling fearful and yet full of joy,
for surely nothing could be stronger than the massive
chain which was wound round and round the prostrate
wolf. But Fenrer rose slowly, stretched himself,
and gave one bound into the air, while the gods
drew back in dismay before the rattling shower of

This chain was called Drome. <a href="#FNanchor_24_24">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then Odin saw that no brass or steel or any metal
could withstand the terrible strength of the wolf,
and he bade Thor give up all further attempts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
forge a chain, while he had it proclaimed throughout
Asgard that Fenrer was to roam wherever he
would. Shortly after this he sent Loki on a journey
far across the seas to a country so distant from Asgard
that he would have to be gone many days. Though
usually alert and suspicious, Loki set off on his
errand, not dreaming that Odin had some purpose
in sending him away. As soon as he was gone, Odin
despatched Skirner, Freyr&rsquo;s trusty servant, with
all speed to the home of the swarthy elves, and bade
him procure from them an enchanted chain, such as
they alone knew how to make. Skirner set out at
once and found his journey a safer and pleasanter
one than he had expected, for though the home of the
dwarfs was underground, the road was easy to find.
Odin had instructed him to look at the base of a
certain mountain for a tiny stream of opal-tinted
water. Having come to the foot of the mountain,
Skirner followed the stream to its rocky source, and
the rest of the journey was quickly made.</p>

<p>When he delivered his message to the elves,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
they set immediately to work, and for nine days and
nights Skirner heard no sound in the workshop as
the little men plied their task. No stroke of hammer
or noise of anvil was necessary in the making of this
wonderful chain, for into its weaving went the strangest
things that Skirner had ever seen,&mdash;the down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
from a butterfly&rsquo;s wing, a handful of moonbeams, the
lace of a spider&rsquo;s web, a humming bird&rsquo;s lance, the
breath of the night wind and many other queer
and mysterious things. The work was all done in
perfect silence, and Skirner sat by looking on in
wonder as the magic chain grew into being under the
elves&rsquo; skilful fingers. At last it was finished, and
with the precious gift in his hands, Skirner hastened
back to Asgard.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_25_25">[25]</a></span>
The home of the elves was in Svartalfheim. <a href="#FNanchor_25_25">Back</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_26_26">[26]</a></span>
This magic chain was called Gleipnir. <a href="#FNanchor_26_26">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then Odin called the gods together and summoned
Fenrer to come and try his strength a third time.
When the wolf saw the chain which was to bind him,
he became at once suspicious, especially when he
found that Loki was absent. He had no doubt of
his power to break brass and steel, but he scented a
possible danger in the soft, fine thread which lay in
Odin&rsquo;s hand. As he had no one here to warn him
if the gods meant mischief, he felt that it was safer
to wait until Loki was present; so he drew away,
growling and showing his teeth. At this Thor
cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, Fenrer, have you used up all your
strength in breaking those heavy chains, and have
not enough left to snap this slender thread?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This taunt made the wolf growl more fiercely than
ever, though he consented a third time to be bound,
demanding first, however, that one of the gods should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
put his hand in the huge mouth, and leave it there
as a pledge that no magic arts were being used against
him. None of the gods wished to take such a risk,
and they all drew back in dismay except Tyr, the
sword-god, who stepped boldly forward and thrust
his hand into the wolf&rsquo;s mouth. Then Fenrer submitted
to be bound, and allowed the gods to wind the
slender thread all about him and fasten the end to
a rock. The moment it was secured, the wolf tried
as before to shake himself free, but the more he
struggled and strained, the tighter grew the magic
thread, until at last Fenrer lay bound and helpless
and foaming madly with rage. Seeing that he had
been tricked, he closed his teeth savagely upon Tyr&rsquo;s
fingers, and bit off his whole hand. But the sword-god
felt repaid for the loss of his hand since the
wolf at last was bound. Thus the gods left him
securely chained to the rock; and there he lay until
the final terrible day when it was decreed that he
should break loose again, and help in bringing
destruction upon all the dwellers of Asgard.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>How Thor Went Fishing</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day the gods went to a feast given by
&AElig;ger the sea-god; and they drank so much
ale that before the meal was half over the
vessel which old &AElig;ger had filled was drained dry.
He was greatly distressed at finding there was not
enough to drink, and he began at once to brew more
of the foaming ale. As his kettle was rather small
for so great a company, he asked Thor to find him
a larger one that would better suit the needs of the
gods. To this Thor, who was always ready for any
sort of adventure, replied readily,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me where to get the kettle, and I will fetch
it, even if it is from the very heart of J&ouml;tunheim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now &AElig;ger had no idea where to look for such an
enormous kettle as he needed; but just then Tyr
spoke up and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father Hymer has a kettle that is one mile
deep and half a mile wide. If Thor wishes to risk
the giant&rsquo;s anger, he can go with me to Hymer&rsquo;s
castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two gods set off for their long journey in
Thor&rsquo;s swift goat-chariot; and though they travelled
quickly over the frost-bound country that stretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
far away to the north, it was a long time before they
came to the land where Hymer and his kindred
lived. Here they had to cross two half-frozen rivers
over which the goats carried them safely, and then
they came to the foot of a great ice-covered mountain
that looked as smooth as glass. Tyr advised
that they go the rest of the way on foot; so, leaving
the chariot by some low fir trees, the two gods proceeded
to climb up the slippery side of the mountain.</p>

<p>Almost at the top they came upon Hymer&rsquo;s
castle, and they entered the spacious hall where a
huge fire, made of entire trees, was burning on the
hearth. Near the fire was seated Tyr&rsquo;s grandmother,
a hideous old giantess who did not speak to the two
gods as they entered, but only grinned horridly at
them, showing her long, pointed teeth that looked
like a wolf&rsquo;s fangs. Beside her sat a beautiful woman
spinning flax with a golden wheel. This was Tyr&rsquo;s
mother, who was as lovely as the old woman was
hideous, and as kind as the hag was cruel. She
welcomed her son affectionately, but warned him
that both he and Thor had better keep hidden until
they found out whether Hymer was disposed to be
friendly&mdash;for when the giant was angry he was
not a pleasant person to encounter.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Hymer came home, tired and
ill-tempered after an unsuccessful day&rsquo;s fishing. He
shook the snow from his clothes and combed the ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
out of his long, white beard. Then he sat down by
the fire, and while he watched the meat turn on the
spit, Tyr&rsquo;s mother said softly: &ldquo;Our son has come
to see you. Shall we welcome him to the fire?&rdquo;
Before Hymer could answer, the old giantess croaked
out, &ldquo;And Thor has come with him&mdash;the strongest
god in Asgard and the enemy of our race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hymer looked very angry as he heard this, and
when his old mother cried, &ldquo;Look, they are hiding
behind the furthest pillar,&rdquo; the giant stared at the
pillar with such a piercing look that it cracked in
two. Then the beam overhead suddenly snapped,
and the kettles that were hanging from it fell with
a crash to the floor. There were eight of these
kettles, and among them was the huge one of which
Tyr had spoken to the sea-god. All of the kettles
were broken by the fall except the largest; and
as Hymer was stooping to pick this up, Tyr and
Thor walked out from behind the pillar.</p>

<p>The giant was not very well pleased to see Thor,
but as the visitor came in company with his son, he
decided to treat him civilly. So he invited the
two gods to come and eat with him, and made a
place for them by the fire. There were three oxen
served for supper; and after Thor had eaten two of
them and started on a third, Hymer cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, there! If you eat all our meat, you will
have to catch us some fish to-morrow.&rdquo; Thor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
laughed and replied that he was only too glad of a
chance to go fishing. So next morning when the
giant set off at sunrise, Thor went with him to the
beach, and watched him get the lines and the nets
ready. &ldquo;If I am to catch the fish, will you give
me some bait?&rdquo; he asked, and Hymer replied with
a growl, &ldquo;Go and find some for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Thor went over to the meadow where the giant&rsquo;s
cattle were grazing, and, seizing the largest bull by
the neck, he wrung off its head, and carried this
down to the boat. Hymer was very angry at this
treatment of his property, but he said nothing, only
bade Thor take the oars. Then he gave the boat
a great shove, and sprang in with such violence that
the whole craft was almost overturned.</p>

<p>Under Thor&rsquo;s quick strokes the boat shot over
the water like an arrow, and the giant looked a bit
surprised to see how well his companion could pull.
With every dip of the oars the boat gathered speed,
and they very soon reached Hymer&rsquo;s fishing ground.
He then called to Thor to stop rowing, but the god
only shook his head and pulled all the harder. In
a few moments they were out of sight of land, and
the boat was swinging heavily in the trough of the
sea. Hymer begged Thor not to go any farther,
but the god laughed and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is much better fishing a few miles ahead.&rdquo;
Then he bent hard at the oars, and the boat flew over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
the waves with incredible swiftness. Soon Hymer
began to be frightened, and called loudly, &ldquo;If you
go much farther, we shall be over the Midgard
serpent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this was just what Thor intended; so he
kept on rowing until they were just over the spot
where the huge snake lay coiled at the bottom of
the ocean with his tail in his mouth. Then Thor
drew in his oars and began to bait his line with the
bull&rsquo;s head. Hymer had his things all ready for
fishing, and as soon as he dropped his line into the
sea the bait was grabbed with a sudden jerk which
nearly toppled the giant overboard. Regaining his
balance, he proudly pulled up out of the water two
whales, and flung them in the boat. Then Thor
threw out his line, and in a moment the whole sea
was in an uproar, for the bait had been seized by the
Midgard serpent and the hook was now caught fast
in its great mouth.</p>

<p>When Thor felt the terrible pull on his line, he
grasped it with all his might, and braced himself
against the side of the boat. The serpent was indeed
a match for him in strength, and Thor&mdash;to
prevent being dragged out into the water&mdash;set
himself with such force against the framework of the
boat that his feet broke right through, and he found
himself standing on the bottom of the sea. Here
he could take such firm hold that he was able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
draw the serpent up to the edge of the boat. The
monster lashed the waves fiercely with its tail, and
churned the water into foam as it writhed about
in its efforts to get free from the torturing hook.
Its great head rose above the boat&rsquo;s side, and in its
struggles the beast looked more terrifying than
when its glittering eyes and great coiled body frightened
the dwellers in Asgard.</p>

<p>But Thor was determined not to let the serpent
go, so he only pulled the harder and the sea became
a great whirlpool of blood and foam and tossing
waves. Hymer, who had been looking on in amazement
at Thor&rsquo;s strength, now sprang forward and
cut the line just as the god was raising his hammer to
crush the monster&rsquo;s head. The Midgard serpent
immediately sank out of sight, and Thor&mdash;wrathful
at Hymer&rsquo;s interference&mdash;struck the giant such a
blow that he tumbled headlong into the sea. In a
moment, however, he had scrambled back into the
boat, and bade Thor take up the oars and row back
to land. When they reached the shore, Hymer
slung the two whales over his shoulder, and carried
them up to his castle. Thor, having no fish, picked
up the boat, and brought it along with him.</p>

<p>As soon as they were seated again by the fire,
Hymer challenged his guest to prove his great
strength by breaking a certain drinking-cup. Thor
took the cup and threw it against the furthest stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
pillar. It struck with a terrific crash, but&mdash;much to
Thor&rsquo;s surprise&mdash;it fell to the ground unbroken.
Then he hurled it at the massive granite wall, but
it bounded back like a ball, and dropped at his feet.
Thor looked very disconcerted as he stared at the
uncracked surface of the cup; and, as he was about
to own himself defeated, he heard a soft voice say,
&ldquo;Throw it at Hymer&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he knew that this kindly advice was
given by Tyr&rsquo;s mother, he did not dare to turn and
thank her, but he took up the cup and dashed it at
Hymer&rsquo;s forehead. Terrific as the blow was, it did
not seem to harm the giant at all, but the cup was
shattered in a thousand pieces. The giant was very
angry at having lost his wager; but he was now so
thoroughly afraid of Thor&rsquo;s great strength and cunning
that he made no objection when Tyr asked for
the great kettle to carry back to the sea-god &AElig;ger.
&ldquo;Take it then, if you must,&rdquo; he growled sullenly.
Tyr made the first attempt to lift the kettle, but he
could not so much as raise it from the ground.
Thor, however, picked it up with great ease and set
it on his head like a helmet. Then he marched
boldly out of Hymer&rsquo;s castle with Tyr following
close behind him.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far down the mountain
when Tyr, looking back, cried out that they were
being pursued. And true enough, right at their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
heels was Hymer with a great company of giants
ready to fall upon them. Thor did not even lift
the kettle from his shoulders, but he swung Mj&ouml;lner
around his head until the lightning flashed and the
thunder shook the hills. Then he rushed at the
giants, hurling the hammer right and left; and in
a short time not one of the pursuers remained alive.
Then Thor and Tyr resumed their journey, and soon
came to the spot where the goat-chariot was waiting.
This bore them swiftly to &AElig;ger&rsquo;s palace, and the
gods laughed merrily when they saw Thor enter
with the kettle on his head. That night there was
such a mighty brewing of ale that it seemed as if
none of the company could ever be thirsty again.</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>The Building of the Fortress</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LTHOUGH the gods had felt less fear of the
frost-giants since the mighty Mj&ouml;lner had been
given to Thor, they were often very anxious
when the Thunderer was obliged&mdash;as he sometimes
was&mdash;to go off on a long journey. Then Asgard
was left quite unprotected; for although the gods
were brave and strong fighters, they would be no
match for the frost-giants if their old enemies came
against them in great numbers. So they wished
very much for some assurance of safety in Thor&rsquo;s
absence; and the best protection would undoubtedly
be a high stone fortress that would encircle the whole
of Asgard. But who was to build it?</p>

<p>Even if some of the gods were willing to undertake
such a long, difficult task, who among them
could spare the time for it, and who could lift the
heavy stones that would be needed for the work?
It seemed therefore as if the hope of having a fortress
must be given up, for even Loki&rsquo;s quick wit could
devise nothing; but one morning Heimdall, who
guarded the rainbow bridge, blew a loud blast on
his horn to announce the approach of a stranger.
When Odin looked down from his throne, he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
a huge figure standing beside Heimdall, and he knew
at once that his visitor was one of the frost-giants.
He stepped down from his golden throne, and, crossing
the many-coloured Bifrost, he stood before the
stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you seek here in sunny Asgard?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a master-builder,&rdquo; replied the giant,
&ldquo;and I have been told that you needed a clever
mason to build you a fortress. Give me the work
to do and you shall have a strong wall about your
shining city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Odin knew that no word about the proposed
fortress had ever been breathed outside of Asgard;
but he knew also that it was useless to make any
denial, for the frost-giants, with their mysterious
wisdom, had somehow learned the truth. So he
said to the stranger: &ldquo;We <em>do</em> need a fortress. Can
you build one strong enough to resist any attack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can,&rdquo; replied the giant, quickly. &ldquo;And
when my work is finished, I will promise you that
all the forces in the universe could not move one
stone from the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will it take you to build the fortress?&rdquo;
asked Odin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just one year&mdash;which is a very short allowance
of time for so great a task,&rdquo; answered the
giant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
&ldquo;And what payment do you ask for your work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wages must be the sun and moon and Freya
for my wife,&rdquo; cried the giant, boldly.</p>

<p>This demand astonished and angered Odin; but,
remembering how much he was in need of such help
as the giant could give, he concealed his wrath under
soft words and bade the master-builder come the
next day for his answer.</p>

<p>When Odin called the gods together in the great
council-hall and told them what the frost-giant demanded
as payment for his work, a murmur of disapproval
arose. Soon all the company cried out
against making so dreadful a sacrifice; for it would
be cruel to deliver the beautiful Freya to the arms of
a giant. It was impossible to lose the maiden who
was the light and joy of Asgard, and it was equally
impossible to take the sun and moon from the
heavens and compel the helpless earth to sit forever
in darkness. So the gods decided to tell the giant
that they would not accept his terms. Just then
Loki spoke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let my wit and cunning&mdash;which you always
condemn&mdash;find a way out of the difficulty. We will
agree to the builder&rsquo;s demands, but you may trust
me to see that he does not get a single one of the
things he covets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gods were apt to doubt Loki&rsquo;s wisdom, and
they always distrusted his motives; but they knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
that his craftiness and trickery often helped him in
his own difficulties, and they were now willing to
use any means that offered a way out of their trouble.
So they listened to Loki&rsquo;s plans, and next day, when
the giant came for his answer, Odin told him that
the gods would accept his terms if he would promise
to build the fortress in a single winter. He was also
to agree to give up his claims if the work was not
finished by the first day of summer.</p>

<p>The giant was not pleased with these conditions,
and he grumbled a great deal about the short time
that was given him. He promised, however, to
undertake the building of the fortress, and agreed
to have it finished by the first day of summer if he
could have his horse to help him in his work. Now
Loki was not present when the giant made this request;
but Odin saw no reason why it should not
be granted, so he told the builder to come the next
day at sunrise and bring his horse with him. When
Loki saw how the giant was going to be helped in
the work, he was not so certain that his own wit
could save the day; for the helper which the builder
brought was an immense horse named Svadilfare,
who could work night and day. This wonderful
creature not only dragged the great blocks of stone
for the building, but also set them in place with his
strong fore-legs. The gods looked on in dismay as
they saw how fast the work progressed, and berated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
Loki for having induced them to accept the giant&rsquo;s
offer.</p>

<p>The long winter wore on, and the fortress grew
as if by magic. The giant worked steadily without
taking a moment to rest, and the wonderful
Svadilfare brought pile after pile of huge stones to
the spot where the builder was toiling with might
and main. A few days before the end of the winter
the work was all finished except one large slab that
was to form the top of the gateway. The gods
were now so alarmed at the prospect of having to
pay the giant his extortionate wages that they
threatened Loki with the direst punishments if
he did not find some way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>So that night as Svadilfare was wearily dragging
to the gateway the last stone that was to complete
the fortress, Loki changed himself into a pretty
little mare; and, trotting up to the great horse, said&mdash;in
perfect equine language&mdash;&ldquo;Why must you
work so hard when there are yet three days in which
to lay this stone? Come with me for a romp in the
meadows. You can be back again before your
master returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Svadilfare knew that he ought not to leave
his work; but his master was absent and he was
very tired, and there was plenty of time to lay this
last stone. So when the little mare trotted away
still calling to him, he kicked off his harness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
galloped delightedly after her. When the giant
came to view the last of the work, one great stone
lay by the unfinished gateway and the horse was
nowhere to be seen. Believing that the gods had
purposely hidden him in Asgard, he demanded the
right to search the city; but no print of Svadilfare&rsquo;s
feet were to be seen on the unmarred streets
of gold. Then the giant rushed madly over the
earth, and so heavy was his tread that the dwellers
in Midgard awoke at night in terror, fearing that an
earthquake was shaking the ground beneath them.
Into the remotest corners of the earth and even as
far as J&ouml;tunheim the giant searched for his missing
horse; but he never found the secret grove where
Loki was in hiding with Svadilfare. When the
builder at last returned to Asgard, the first day of
summer had dawned, and, by the terms of the agreement,
he had forfeited his wages.</p>

<p>The gods had assembled just inside the fortress;
and when the giant came raging toward them they
were glad that Thor had returned from his long
journey and now stood among them with the mighty
Mj&ouml;lner in his hand. The builder knew that in
some way he had been tricked into losing his wager;
so when Odin demanded that he should leave Asgard
and not trouble the gods any further, he flew into a
terrible rage and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this fortress were not so strongly built, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
would pull it to pieces so that you might not mock
me.&rdquo; Then he rushed past the assembled company
and into the many-pillared hall of Valhalla, crying:
&ldquo;Not for nothing does a frost-giant stand within
the walls of Asgard. Your palaces are not built
to stand forever, and I will send them crashing about
your heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he grasped two of the pillars in his
powerful arms, and it is probable that the beautiful
building would have fallen if Thor had not rushed
forward at this moment and struck the giant such
a blow with his hammer that the builder&rsquo;s head was
shattered in a thousand pieces. Then the huge
body toppled headlong over the rainbow bridge, and
kept on falling until at last it sank into the fathomless
gulf that borders on the Land of Mists.</p>

<p>Thus the gods obtained their much-needed fortress,
and Freya stayed happily in Asgard. There was
now a sure protection against the invasion of the
frost-giants; but over the gateway, one stone was
always lacking, for no one among the gods was strong
enough to set it into place.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a>How the Hammer Was Lost and
Found</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE mighty hammer Mj&ouml;lner was not only
a protection to Asgard, but served to keep the
frost-giants from doing harm to the earth.
This whole race hated brightness, and were not content
to live themselves in a land of ice and snow and
mist, but tried to make all the world like their own
dreary country. They longed to take the sunlight
from the earth, to kill the flowers and cover every green
thing with a mantle of blighting frost. They would
have done all this if they had not been afraid of Thor&rsquo;s
hammer, for whenever they strayed too far from
J&ouml;tunheim and tried to nip the leaves and flowers with
their icy fingers, Thor would drive them out of Midgard
with his hammer; and the thunder and lightning
would follow hard upon them until they were
once more within the limits of their frozen hills.</p>

<p>One day Thor came back from a long journey,
and being very tired he dropped down on the steps
of his palace and fell into a heavy sleep. When at
length he awoke, he found to his horror and dismay
that Mj&ouml;lner was no longer in his hand or by his side.
Some one must have come while he was sleeping and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
stolen it away. Thor felt certain that it was one of
the frost-giants, for none of the gods, not even the
mischief-loving Loki, would have dared to commit
this theft. But no one had seen any of the giants
lurking about Asgard, and Odin&rsquo;s ravens had not met
with them in their flights to and from the earth.
Yet it must have been some one of their ancient
enemies who had stolen Mj&ouml;lner, and therefore
the hammer must be recovered speedily or the whole
race of giants would soon come to take possession of
Asgard now that its chief means of defence was gone.
So Thor went in haste to Loki and begged him to
devise some plan to recover the hammer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go myself,&rdquo; said Loki, &ldquo;and see if I can
find out who has stolen Mj&ouml;lner. Perhaps we can
regain it before it is too late, for the thief may not
yet have spread the news of its capture to his kindred.&rdquo;
Thor was ready to welcome any suggestion,
so he readily agreed to this plan, and Loki hurried
off to the flower-filled garden where Freya was wont
to walk.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He told the goddess of the theft of
Mj&ouml;lner and begged her to lend him her falcon plumage
so that he might waste no time in his search.
Freya gladly gave him her feathery disguise, and
Loki sped northward across the frozen sea until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
he came to J&ouml;tunheim. He shivered continually
under his delicate plumage, for this ice-bound land
with its snow-covered mountains wrapped in the cold
of eternal winter was different indeed from sunny
Asgard.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_27_27">[27]</a></span>
Freya&rsquo;s palace was called Folkvang. She sometimes
drove in a chariot drawn by cats. From her name comes our
word Friday. <a href="#FNanchor_27_27">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>He walked for a long time without meeting any
one, but at last he found the giant Thrym seated on
the side of a mountain, counting his flock of sheep.
The giant was very ugly, and he was also terribly
big and strong, but Loki felt no fear of him. He
perched on a rock beside Thrym, who looked at him
craftily a moment and then said, &ldquo;Why does Loki
try to deceive those who know more than the gods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that his disguise would now be of little
service, Loki assumed his own form, and drawing
nearer to the giant greeted him in turn as a friend.
Thrym did not seem at all surprised at seeing a
god in J&ouml;tunheim; but he looked rather uneasily
around, and went on counting his sheep without
replying to Loki&rsquo;s greeting. The cunning god then
instantly surmised that here was the thief who had
taken Thor&rsquo;s hammer; so, in threatening tones, he
accused the giant of the theft, and demanded that
Mj&ouml;lner be at once returned. It was a bold stroke,
but it did not deceive Thrym in the least, for he knew
that Loki was making mere empty threats, since
Mj&ouml;lner was no longer in Asgard.</p>

<p>Then Loki made the giant many promises of rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
rewards from Odin, and told him of the good-will
which all the gods would have for him if he returned
the hammer to Thor. At this Thrym began to laugh,
and he laughed so loud that the trees upon the mountain
shook. Then he tore up by the roots a huge oak
tree and threw it like a straw into the sea, and
turning to Loki said: &ldquo;You will never find that
hammer, friend Loki, for I have buried it nine
fathoms in the earth, and neither you nor Thor shall
ever see it again. Yet, if you really need the hammer
as a protection to your city, there is one condition
on which I return it. You must give me the beautiful
Freya for my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proposal rather staggered Loki, for he knew
how impossible such a thing was. But he said nothing,
only bade Thrym good-by and hastened back
to Asgard.</p>

<p>When Loki reported to Odin the result of his
journey, the gods held a council to decide what it
was best to do. Of course it was out of the question
to try to induce Freya to become Thrym&rsquo;s wife, and
Odin could not feel justified in demanding such a
sacrifice. When the maiden herself learned of the
giant&rsquo;s proposal, she grew so angry at the insult
that the necklace of stars which she wore around her
slender throat broke; and as the shining pieces fell
through the air, people in Midgard exclaimed with
delight at the shooting stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
Since it was impossible to think of yielding Freya
to a giant even to recover Mj&ouml;lner, the gods tried to
form some other plan, and again they turned to
Loki for help, for he alone was clever enough to outwit
the giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no way to get the hammer,&rdquo; said Loki,
&ldquo;except by giving Thrym a bride; and since we
cannot send any of the goddesses to the cold northland,
we must find the giant another wife. Let us
dress up Thor like a woman and send him instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; roared Thor; &ldquo;I should be the laughing-stock
of every one in Asgard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Loki, who rather enjoyed
having Thor at his mercy; &ldquo;and what if you were?
Is that anything compared to seeing the whole race
of frost-giants at the gates of Asgard? If something
is not done very soon, they will be ruling here in our
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The situation was indeed so critical that at length
Thor consented to the plan, though much against
his will. So Loki put on him a rich robe embroidered
with gold, and wound a chain about his neck and put
a beautiful girdle at his waist. Then he threw over
Thor&rsquo;s head a long bridal-veil, while he attired
himself as a waiting maid to attend the bride.
The gods harnessed Thor&rsquo;s milk-white goats to the
chariot, and together Thor and Loki set out for the
frost-giants&rsquo; country. It was very difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
restrain the pretended bride from thrusting her sinewy
hands from under the veil, and Loki feared that even
a love-lorn giant would not be fooled into believing
that those massive shoulders belonged to a maiden.</p>

<p>When Thrym beheld the bridal party coming, he
was filled with joy and ran to meet them. He wished
very much to raise the bride&rsquo;s veil, but Loki forbade
him until after the wedding ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goddess Freya who has come to be your wife
is very timid,&rdquo; said Loki, &ldquo;and you must not distress
her with your attentions, or she may grow
frightened and wish to return to Asgard.&rdquo; So
Thrym obeyed Loki&rsquo;s command, and led the bride
to his palace, where his kinsmen were assembled.
There they found the tables spread with meat and
wine as if for a feast. Thrym urged his bride to
partake of the fruits and delicacies which had been
brought especially for her, and with some show of
reluctance the supposed woman began to eat. First
she devoured eight large salmon, then twelve roasted
birds, and soon followed this up with eating a whole
ox and drinking three barrels of mead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ever a maiden eat like this one?&rdquo; thought the
giants, and in their hearts they pitied Thrym for
getting such a wife. When they spoke of the bride&rsquo;s
appetite to Loki, he replied, &ldquo;It is eight days since
Freya has eaten anything, for she was so overjoyed
at wedding Thrym, that she could not touch any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
food.&rdquo; Thrym was too happy to notice what the
bride ate, and when the feast was over he cried to his
brother, &ldquo;Bring hither the hammer Mj&ouml;lner and
place it in the bride&rsquo;s lap; then let us be wedded in
the name of Var.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the hammer was brought and placed in Thor&rsquo;s
hand; but the minute his fingers closed around it
he tore the veil from his face, and the terrified giants
beheld, not the mild countenance of Freya, but the
face of the Thunderer himself. It was too late
now to escape, and the giants were so frightened
that they could not move, even if they had known
where to flee from the fierce anger that blazed in
Thor&rsquo;s eyes. He had barely swung the hammer
twice around his head when thunder and lightning
was mingled with the crash of falling buildings;
and those of the giants who were not killed by the
blows of the hammer were buried beneath the
crumbling ruins. Thus did Mj&ouml;lner return at last
to Asgard.</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>Iduna&rsquo;s Apples</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH sorrow sometimes came to the people
of Asgard and they shared the burden of
grief and trouble that afflicted the human
race, yet as gods they had one privilege which belonged
to them alone,&mdash;the blessing of eternal
youth. Sickness and old age never came within the
gates of Asgard; and this was because the goddess
Iduna had some very wonderful apples which gave,
to those who ate of them, the strength and beauty
of youth.</p>

<p>In appearance they were very much like other
apples, of a beautiful red and gold; but when the
gods had eaten of them they knew that such fruit
could not be found anywhere outside of Asgard.
For no other apples except those in Iduna&rsquo;s casket
could bestow eternal youth and the power to defy
all sickness and pain.</p>

<p>The goddess herself was very proud of her treasures,
and proud, too, of the confidence which Odin
placed in her in making her the guardian of a thing
so priceless. The casket in which she kept the apples
had only a single key, and this Iduna kept fastened
to her girdle. Wherever she went she carried the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
precious casket with her, and never let it be for a
moment out of her sight. The gods felt no uneasiness
while the apples were in such safe keeping, and
there seemed to be no reason why they should ever
lose the beauty and health and youth which had
always been theirs. But one day both Iduna and
her golden apples disappeared from Asgard, and no
one knew where they had gone,&mdash;no one but Loki,
and he would not tell. This is how it happened.</p>

<p>Odin and Loki and H&oelig;nir once went on a visit
to the land of the frost-giants to find out, if possible,
whether they were plotting any new invasion of
Asgard. It was an uncomfortable journey, for the
air was bitterly cold and the ground hard and frozen,
so there was no pleasure in travelling. They even
felt rather sorry for the people who were condemned
to live forever in such a cheerless country. They were
hungry, too, and could find nothing to eat; no game
to kill, no fish to catch, not even any wild berries
upon the barren hillsides. So Odin proposed that
they return at once to Asgard; but just then Loki
saw a herd of cows grazing near by, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is meat in abundance. Let us eat before
we set out again on our journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he killed the fattest of the cows, and bore
it on his shoulder to the spot where Odin and H&oelig;nir
were already building a fire. They cut the meat and
put it upon a spit; and while Loki turned it, the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
others piled logs upon the fire. Now and then they
tasted the flesh, thinking it must be cooked; but
each time it was as raw as when they had first cut
it. Then Odin threw on more logs, and the heat
became so intense that the gods could hardly stand
near it. Still the meat remained uncooked. All
night long they took turns cooking and tending the
fire; but morning found them hungrier than ever,
and with yet no prospect of a meal. This was too
much for even the good-natured H&oelig;nir, while Loki
became so angry that he would have killed the whole
herd of cows and thrown them into the sea out of
mere spite. But Odin laughed and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Loki, do not let us vent our anger so
foolishly. We will return, rather, to Asgard, and
tell the gods that, in spite of the drink from Mimir&rsquo;s
well, the frost-giants are yet wiser than Odin.&rdquo;
For he knew that it was through some mysterious
intervention of their old enemy that they could not
enjoy the much-needed dinner.</p>

<p>Just then there came a loud noise and a whirring
of wings overhead, and, looking up, they saw a large
eagle hovering above them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;so you cannot cook your
dinner, I see. The meat must be tough indeed that
will not yield to such a fire. But give me your
promise that you will share the feast with me, and
I will pledge you to get it cooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
The gods promised very gladly, and the eagle,
moving nearer, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand aside and let me blow up the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suspecting nothing, the gods moved away, and as
they did so the eagle swooped down, and, seizing in
his strong claws all the meat that was on the spit,
he began to flap his huge wings and rise slowly into
the air.</p>

<p>When the gods saw that the eagle meant to trick
them, they grew very angry, and Loki, hoping to
snatch his prize from the treacherous giant,&mdash;for
that was what the thief really was,&mdash;grasped one
end of the spit as it rose into the air and tried to drag
it downward. But the eagle&rsquo;s strength was greater
than the god&rsquo;s, and he flew higher and higher, carrying
the luckless Loki with him. Up they soared, far
above the heads of the bewildered H&oelig;nir and Odin,
who were helpless to rescue their comrade, and could
only stand by and watch him disappearing from view.
Over the frozen sea and the snow-covered mountains
the eagle carried the unhappy Loki, not pausing in
his flight until they reached a huge iceberg. Here
he stopped, and dropped Loki upon the ground, where
the bruised and weary god was glad to rest; for the
eagle had dragged him over ice and snow, sharp
stones and frost-bound stubble that stung like so
many thorns.</p>

<p>The moment the bird alighted it was no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
an eagle, but the giant Thiassi, who grinned maliciously
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like flying, friend Loki?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loki was in such a rage that he was tempted to
try to hurl the giant from the iceberg. He knew,
however, that this would only shut him off from a
speedy return to his companions, so he restrained his
anger and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can indeed rival the gods in swiftness, and I
should be glad to journey farther with you, but
Odin demands my return to Asgard. Take me back
to him, therefore, with all speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant laughed at Loki&rsquo;s assumed boldness, and
answered: &ldquo;The gods are great indeed, but the frost-giants
have no fear of them. Odin may need you
in Asgard, but you shall not return except on one
condition&mdash;that you promise to deliver into my
power the goddess Iduna and her golden apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some time Loki did not answer, for he hardly
dared to make such a promise, since the loss of
Iduna from Asgard would mean old age and possible
death to the gods. Still, he did not intend to remain
any longer on the iceberg. Knowing well the
stubborn persistence of the whole race of giants,
he felt that cajolery and threats were alike useless,
so he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant knew Loki&rsquo;s reputation for cunning, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
therefore he demanded that the god should swear
by Odin&rsquo;s spear to keep his promise. Loki did this,
though with great reluctance, and the giant then
assumed his eagle plumage and carried the god
swiftly back to the place where Odin and H&oelig;nir were
still standing by the burnt-out fire. In answer to
their questions, Loki told them of his strange journey,
but made no mention of his promise to the giant.
Then the three gods returned to Asgard.</p>

<p>Some time later, Loki went to the palace of Iduna
and asked to see her apples. The goddess willingly
brought out her casket, for she never wearied of
looking at the precious fruit; but as she handed
Loki the apples, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange indeed for you to care so much for
beauty&mdash;or is it that life is aging you more quickly
than the others of Asgard, and you need still another
of Iduna&rsquo;s apples?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Loki, &ldquo;it is not for that reason
that I desire to see your beautiful fruit; but because
I wish to assure myself that they are really the best
apples in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where would you find such as these?&rdquo;
asked Iduna in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just beyond the gates of Asgard,&rdquo; answered
Loki, &ldquo;is a wonderful tree which bears fruit in all
respects like these apples you prize so highly. I
think they look even fresher, and as I tasted them I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
felt sure that they were finer in flavour than any
you have here. It is a pity you cannot go and see
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it far from here?&rdquo; asked the goddess, wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Loki; &ldquo;just outside the
city gates. It would be such a delight to you to see
them, for they are so fine as they hang in the sunlight,
and so easy to reach, too. Some day I will tell you
more about them, but now I must be away, for Odin
has a commission for me to-day.&rdquo; So saying, he
took his departure, and Iduna was left alone.</p>

<p>For a long time she thought over what Loki had
said, and the longing grew very strong to go and see
those apples which he had declared were even finer
than her own. She dared not go away and leave
her casket behind; but there surely could be no
harm in taking it with her just a little way outside
the gates of Asgard. Still she was doubtful and
troubled, and wished that her husband, Bragi, were
at home, that she might ask his advice. For a long
time she hesitated, but at last her curiosity grew too
strong to be resisted, and with her casket on her
arm she left the palace and hurried outside the city
gates.</p>

<p>She looked carefully all about her, but she saw no
tree such as Loki had described. Discouraged and
disappointed, she was about to return home, when she
heard a loud noise overhead, and, looking up, saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
a large eagle flying toward her. In a moment he
had rushed down upon her, and before the terrified
goddess realized what had happened, he had caught
her up in his strong claws, and was carrying her above
the tree tops. In vain did she scream and struggle,
for the eagle soared higher and higher, carrying her
far out of sight of Asgard. He flew straight as an
arrow across the mountains and over the frozen sea
till he came to his home in the dreary northland.
Here he took the form of the terrible giant Thiassi
and began to beg the goddess for one of her apples.
Iduna, frightened and trembling, kept the precious
key of the casket clasped tight in her hand, and
boldly refused to betray her trust by giving the giant
even a sight of the apples. So Thiassi shut her up
in his ice-walled palace<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and kept her there many
days, not caring though she grew pale and sick with
longing to return to sunny Asgard.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_28_28">[28]</a></span>
Called Thrymheim. <a href="#FNanchor_28_28">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Meantime, the gods were greatly troubled at the
sudden disappearance of Iduna; and her husband,
Bragi, sought her, sorrowing, over all the earth.
No one had seen her leave Asgard, and none knew
where she had gone or when she would return,&mdash;none
save Loki, and he very wisely kept silent. At
first the gods did not realize what the loss of Iduna
and her apples meant to them; but as time went on
and they felt weariness and old age creeping over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
them, they were filled with fear lest the goddess might
never return, and there would be no longer any way
to keep Death without the gates of Asgard. Odin&rsquo;s
calm brow now became clouded, for not even his
great wisdom was of any help in solving the mystery
of Iduna&rsquo;s strange disappearance. The ravens,
flying far and wide each day, brought no news of
the missing goddess; and meanwhile Time was leaving
its unwelcome marks on the faces of the gods
and goddesses. Frigga&rsquo;s hair began to turn white,
and wrinkles furrowed the fair cheeks of Freya.
The mighty Mj&ouml;lner now trembled in the unsteady
hand of Thor, and the feeble fingers of Bragi could
no longer draw sweet music from his harp; in fact,
all the dwellers in Asgard were growing old, and
there was no way for them to renew their youth.</p>

<p>One day the ravens whispered to Odin that he
should question Loki in regard to Iduna&rsquo;s disappearance,
and Loki was summoned to appear before
Odin&rsquo;s throne. When accused of knowing something
of the missing goddess, he at first stoutly denied all
knowledge of her; but Odin&rsquo;s look seemed to search
his thoughts, and he saw that lying and deceit were
of no avail. So he told all that he had done, and
begged Odin&rsquo;s forgiveness. He promised to set out
at once in search of the stolen goddess, and swore
that he would not return to Asgard until he had found
her and had brought Iduna and her apples safely home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
again. Once more he borrowed the falcon plumage of
Freya and flew over to the frozen northland to the
place where the giant kept Iduna a prisoner in his
ice palace. He found her sitting alone and weeping
bitterly; but Loki wasted no time in trying to
comfort her. She was so overjoyed when the god
assumed his own form and told her why he had come
that she even forgave him for the misery he had led
her into by his treachery. She said that fortunately
Thiassi was off on his daily walk across the hills;
but Loki, wishing to take all precautions, again put
on his falcon plumage, and, by his magic arts, changed
the goddess into a nut which he grasped firmly in his
talons. Then, being warned by Iduna that the giant
never remained long away, he flew with her straight
toward Asgard.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when Thiassi came home;
and when he found Iduna gone, he knew that some
of the gods must have come to her rescue. Nevertheless
he determined not to lose her so easily;
and taking the form of an eagle he flew high up into
the air and looked about for some sign of the fugitive.
Far in the distance he saw a moving speck
among the clouds, and he followed quickly in pursuit.
As he drew nearer he saw the falcon and its
burden, and he knew that Iduna was being carried
back to Asgard. So he redoubled his speed, and his
great wings brought him rapidly nearer the falcon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
whose laboured flight seemed to make an escape from
the enemy impossible.</p>

<p>At Asgard the gods had assembled on the city
walls, and they were now looking anxiously across
the earth, fearing that some misfortune had overtaken
Loki. At last they saw the falcon flying toward
them, and they felt sure that this was Loki
returning with his precious charge. But with the
joy of this discovery came also a sudden fear as they
saw the eagle following close behind the falcon, and
seemingly in hot pursuit. These fears were confirmed
as the birds drew nearer; and then the gods
realized that if they would save Loki and Iduna,
something must be done at once. Nearer and nearer
came the falcon; but though his flight was swift,
he could not keep the pace of his pursuer, and the
eagle was steadily gaining on him. By this time the
gods had built a great pile of wood on the city walls
and were waiting until the falcon with his priceless
burden had flown across it. The moment Loki
passed, they quickly set fire to the wood; and as the
eagle came rushing blindly on, he flew directly over
the flames, which caught his feathers and drew him
down into the fire, burning him to death.</p>

<p>Iduna and her apples were safe at last in Asgard,
and to celebrate her return Odin made a great feast in
his palace hall, and the gods ate again of the golden
fruit and became young and beautiful once more.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>How Thor&rsquo;s Pride Was Brought
Low<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">PART I</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE morning Thor drove hurriedly out of
Asgard in his chariot drawn by the milk-white
goats, and set out on a wonderful
journey. He did not tell Odin where he intended to
go, for he knew that the All-Wise One would try to
persuade him to give up the foolish expedition.
For Thor&rsquo;s purpose was to travel all through J&ouml;tunheim
until he met with the strongest of the giants,
and then challenge him to a combat.</p>

<p>So he left Asgard secretly, and, avoiding the rainbow
bridge as he always did when in his heavy-wheeled
chariot, he directed his swift steeds toward
J&ouml;tunheim. But though he passed through the gates
of Asgard unseen by Odin, he was not quick enough
for Loki, who, thinking that Thor&rsquo;s haste betokened
some unusual adventure, put on his magic shoes and
followed the goats&rsquo; flying feet. He found Thor
quite willing to take him as a companion, and
together the two gods hurried northward. They
had hoped to reach Utgard, the great city of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
giants, before night fell; but by the time they gained
the shores of the ever-frozen sea that marks the
boundary of J&ouml;tunheim, they found that it was too
dark to travel any farther. So they looked about for
some place to pass the night, and just over the hill
they saw a small hut with a friendly light streaming
from the window. When they asked here for food
and shelter, the cottager gladly offered them a
lodging for the night, but he confessed, reluctantly,
that he had no food to give them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That trouble is soon remedied,&rdquo; cried Thor;
and stepping over to where his goats stood browsing
on the scanty grass, he struck them dead with one
blow of his hammer. Then to the great surprise of
the peasant and his family, he skinned the goats and
spread their hides carefully upon the ground. After
this was done, he offered their bodies to his host,
saying: &ldquo;Here is meat enough to furnish us with a
bountiful dinner. I must beg of you, however, not
to break a single one of the animals&rsquo; bones, but
throw them all on the goatskins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peasant and his wife carefully obeyed Thor&rsquo;s
instructions, but the son, Thialfi, was so eager to get
at the marrow in his bone that he broke it. This
greedy act was not seen, however, so the boy hoped
that no harm would come from his disobedience.
The next morning when the gods made ready to
resume their journey, Thor struck the goatskins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
with his hammer, and immediately the bones leaped
into place. In a moment the two animals stood
alive and whole before the eyes of the astonished
cottagers; but one of the goats limped badly.
When Thor noticed this he knew that his commands
had been disobeyed, and he questioned the peasants
angrily. He looked so terrible in his wrath that poor
Thialfi did not dare to confess that he had broken the
bone; and it was only when Thor threatened to
kill the whole family if the guilt were not acknowledged,
that the boy, terrified and trembling, admitted
his deed.</p>

<p>As he seemed so truly sorry for what he had done,
Thor relented and offered to take the lad with him
as his servant. So, leaving the goats and the chariot
in care of the peasant, the two gods resumed their
journey. It was impossible to go very fast on foot,
as the ground was frozen hard and covered with
sharp bits of ice that cut through the travellers&rsquo;
light sandals. The difficulty in crossing the river
was increased by the strong wind which blew from
the high, bleak hills of J&ouml;tunheim, and seemed to lay
an icy hand upon them.</p>

<p>So it was well on into the night before Thor and
Loki reached a desolate stretch of moorland with
mountains standing like grim sentinels all around
it. This was the very heart of the frost-giants&rsquo;
country. There was no protection here that promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
a night&rsquo;s rest, so the travellers kept on till they
came to a strange building which, in the darkness,
seemed to be a five-doored house, opening into a
large courtyard. Here the gods built a fire to cook
their evening meal, and then went gladly to bed,
each of them taking one of the long, narrow rooms.</p>

<p>They had just fallen asleep when a great noise like
the roaring of an angry sea filled their ears, and this
was accompanied by a sort of trembling in the
ground beneath them. Thinking it was a sudden
earthquake, they waited for it to subside; but
the rumbling only increased, and the strange noise
grew almost deafening. This continued for hours,
so that the travellers gave up all hope of sleeping, and
at sunrise they set off again on their journey, after
eating a hasty and sullen meal.</p>

<p>Their road now lay through the thick woods, and
here they were soon halted by the sight of a giant
stretched full length upon the ground. He was so
big that even Thor and Loki, accustomed as they
were to the size of the frost-giants, stared at him in
surprise. As for Thialfi, he dropped the bag of
provisions he was carrying, and hid behind a tree.
The mystery of the strange noise was now solved,
for the gods saw that it was merely the giant&rsquo;s
snoring. The trees around him shook with his
tremendous breathing, and the hills re&euml;choed to the
deafening roar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
The sight of the giant sleeping so peacefully
aroused Thor&rsquo;s anger, and he determined not to be
disturbed any longer by the prodigious snoring.
So he raised his hammer to strike a well-aimed
blow at the sleeper; but just then the giant awoke.
He sat up, and, smiling good-naturedly at the
travellers, said, &ldquo;What brings the mighty Thor and
cunning Loki so far from Asgard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it would be useless to try and deceive any one
as wise as a frost-giant, Thor replied: &ldquo;I have come
to J&ouml;tunheim to measure my strength against the
mightiest of your people. Will you show us the
way to the city of Utgard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will do very gladly,&rdquo; cried the giant,
getting up from the ground and stretching his huge
body until it seemed as if his hands would touch the
clouds. He then picked up a large sack that was
lying near by, and throwing it over his shoulders,
bade Thor and Loki follow him. Before they had
gone far, he stopped, saying, &ldquo;I have forgotten my
glove; it must be somewhere in the forest.&rdquo; As he
refused to proceed any further until it was found,
the gods and Thialfi helped him in his search.
Suddenly the giant reached over the tops of the trees,
and picking up the very house in which the travellers
had spent the night, exclaimed, &ldquo;Here is my
glove! I must have dropped it just before I went to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
Putting the glove into his capacious pocket, and
throwing his bag of provisions again upon his back,
the giant started off across the hills. The gods
had great difficulty in keeping within sight of him;
and Thialfi, who was a swift runner, could barely
hold to the pace the giant set as he covered mile
after mile with each of his great strides.</p>

<p>At nightfall they were still far from the city of
Utgard, so the giant proposed that they should eat
their evening meal, and then sleep under the trees.
The dinner was soon disposed of, and after the giant
had eaten two roasted sheep and drunk a keg of ale,
he stretched himself full length upon the ground.
In a moment he was fast asleep and snoring louder
than ever before.</p>

<p>The two gods knew that it was no use for them to
think of sleeping, so Thor, having nothing better
to do, laid hold of the giant&rsquo;s sack and tried to unfasten
the string with which it seemed so loosely
tied. But the more he pulled at it, the tighter drew
the cord, and Thor despaired of seeing what was
inside the sack unless he ripped it open. This failure
made him very angry, and his anger was further
increased by the giant&rsquo;s continued snoring. When
the gods wished to speak to each other, they could
barely hear their voices above the thunder of the
giant&rsquo;s snores.</p>

<p>At last Thor could restrain his wrath no longer;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
and, raising Mj&ouml;lner high above his head, he dealt
the sleeping figure a terrific blow. The giant opened
his eyes, and looked slowly around him. &ldquo;Did a
leaf fall on my head?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I thought that
I felt something touch me.&rdquo; Then he went off to
sleep again, and began to snore so heavily that the
gods felt the ground shaking beneath them.</p>

<p>Thor was surprised at the ill-success of his blow,
and he grew angrier than ever at the sight of the
giant peacefully sleeping. Then he looked at the
sack with its seemingly simple cord which he could
not untie, and his wrath blazed out afresh. He
rushed at the giant like a charging bull, and the blow
which he dealt him made such a noise that for a
moment it drowned the thunderous snoring. The
giant roused himself with a shake and called, &ldquo;Is
any one throwing acorns at me, or did a twig fall
on my head?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On receiving no answer to his question, he sat up,
and looking around at Thor he smiled pleasantly
and said: &ldquo;Why are you not sleeping, my friends?
If you do not rest, you will be too tired for your journey
to-morrow. But perhaps you are still hungry;
so take what you wish from my sack. There is
plenty for us all.&rdquo; He tossed his bag of provisions
nearer to the gods&mdash;then lay down again and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>Thor was so furious by this time that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
barely wait until the giant was asleep before he
grasped Mj&ouml;lner in both hands and hurled it at the
giant&rsquo;s head. Thialfi, seeing the god beside himself
with rage, shrank back in fear before the terrible
wrath that blazed in the Thunderer&rsquo;s eyes; and he
hid his face in his hands when he heard the crash
that shook the forest when Mj&ouml;lner sank almost up to
the handle in the giant&rsquo;s forehead.</p>

<p>The sleeper stirred uneasily, then sat up, looking
first at the travellers, then up at the trees. &ldquo;Are
there any birds about here?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I thought
I felt one pecking at my forehead.&rdquo; Then he sprang
to his feet, and, taking up his sack of provisions, he
opened the bag very easily and took out half an ox.
&ldquo;It is almost daylight, and we must have an early
start if we wish to reach Utgard by midday,&rdquo; he
continued, smiling pleasantly at his companions,
and offering them the contents of his sack.</p>

<p>Thor was so angry that he could not eat, but Loki
and Thialfi made a good breakfast, and as they ate,
the giant told them what they might expect when
they reached the city of Utgard. &ldquo;You may think
that I am a fairly big fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but when
you see those who live at the court of the king, you
will consider me but a puny thing to be called a
giant. If Thor wishes to find a worthy opponent,
he will meet his equal among Utgard-Loke&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the giant finished eating, he shouldered his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
sack, and laid on top of it the bag of provisions that
the two gods had brought, hoping thus to lighten
their travelling. Then he struck off on a rough path
across the hills, with Thor and Loki hurrying after
him, and Thialfi running at his heels. Soon they
came within sight of Utgard, and when they reached
the city gates, the giant said: &ldquo;I must leave you now,
for my way lies in another direction. I think you
will find a kindly welcome at the court of our king,
and you need have no fear of coming to any harm,
for the frost-giants respect the rights of a guest
even if it is their ancient enemy. But I advise
Thor not to boast too loudly of his strength until
he is sure that his pride will not be humbled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last remark made Thor very angry, and his
fingers closed tightly upon Mj&ouml;lner; but he wisely
kept his temper. He paid no heed to the friendly
words of caution which the giant added as he said
good-by, but strode on ahead through the great
gates that guarded the city of Utgard.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>How Thor&rsquo;s Pride Was Brought
Low<br />
<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">PART II</span></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE way to the palace was quickly found, and
here the two gods were welcomed by the king.
Utgard-Loke sat upon a lordly throne, surrounded
by a company of giants so much larger than
the others of this race which had from time to time
made threatening visits to Asgard that Thor felt
glad of the possession of Mj&ouml;lner. When the travellers
entered his halls, the king greeted them kindly
and asked the object of their journey. Thor told
him boldly that he had come to measure his strength
against that of the giants, and Utgard-Loke courteously
replied: &ldquo;We have heard many tales of
the might of Thor, the defender of Asgard; but we
hope to show him that the frost-giants are no unworthy
opponents. Before we begin our tests of
strength, however, I will ask one of our youths to
meet your servant in some game of skill. Do you
choose what it shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Thor knew that Thialfi was a very swift
runner, so he answered that his servant would run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
a race with any one of the king&rsquo;s young men. Utgard-Loke
then called to a tall, slender youth named
Hugi, and bade him make ready for the race. The
company adjourned to an open meadow, and here
the runners met to test their skill. Thialfi shot over
the ground like an arrow sent by the practised bowman;
but Hugi quickly outdistanced him and came
first to the goal.</p>

<p>The gods were surprised and angry at the ease
with which Hugi gained the victory; but when the
king asked to have a second race, Thor eagerly
agreed, and again Thialfi ran his swiftest. But
although he flew with the lightness and speed of a
race-horse, he found Hugi waiting for him at the
end of the course.</p>

<p>Then Utgard-Loke said, &ldquo;You are a good runner,
Thialfi, but you need to put more speed in your feet
before you can rival Hugi.&rdquo; Now Thor&rsquo;s servant
was almost breathless from his running, and he was
also very tired; but the king&rsquo;s tone seemed so insulting
that he insisted upon a third trial. Again
the two contestants ran over the course, but this
time Hugi gave Thialfi the start of half a mile. In
spite of this advantage, however, the young giant
passed his competitor like the rush of the wind, and
Thialfi lost the race a third time.</p>

<p>As the company had had enough of racing, they
returned to the palace; and Thor, feeling angry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
ashamed at his servant&rsquo;s defeat, began to wish he
had never come to J&ouml;tunheim. Then Utgard-Loke
asked his guests if either of them cared to challenge
one of his men at an eating contest, and Loki eagerly
accepted this chance to prove his ability. &ldquo;I can eat
more than any two of this company,&rdquo; he cried boastfully,
and gave a loud laugh of scorn when an immense
trough full of meat was brought into the room
and placed before him. Then the king summoned
Logi to contend with the brother of Odin, and he and
Loki sat one at each end of the trough.</p>

<p>There was surely never such eating seen before
in all the world. Loki devoured the food so fast
that it seemed as if he would finish all that was set
before him in less than a minute; but when he came
to the middle of the great dish, he found that Logi had
not only eaten his own share, but had finished up the
meat and bones and trough all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let us see what the mightiest of the gods
can do,&rdquo; said the king, as Loki withdrew to the furthest
end of the hall. Thor had been looking on
gloomily at Loki&rsquo;s failure; but the king&rsquo;s tone roused
up all his anger, and he stepped boldly forward, saying,
&ldquo;I will undertake to empty in one draught
any drinking horn that you can place before me.&rdquo;
So Utgard-Loke commanded his men to bring out a
great drinking horn, and as he handed it to Thor
the king said: &ldquo;Here is a cup which the youngest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
among us can empty in three draughts. A strong
man needs to quaff it twice, but a mighty warrior
such as you should finish it all at one drinking.&rdquo;
The king&rsquo;s tone was so insulting that Thor felt his
fingers tighten on the handle of his hammer, and he
longed to hurl it at Utgard-Loke&rsquo;s head; but he
took the horn and set it to his lips.</p>

<p>He drank long and deeply until he felt sure that
he had drained every drop of the liquid; but when he
looked into the horn, he saw that it was but half
emptied. &ldquo;What is the trouble, is the drink too
large for the Mighty One of Asgard?&rdquo; asked Utgard-Loke,
contemptuously. At these words Thor
flew into a great rage, and, grasping the horn more
tightly, he drank as he had never drunk before. Then
he set the vessel down, feeling sure that it must now
be empty; but he found to his surprise that it was
hardly less full than before he began to drink. A
loud laugh of derision greeted him, and the king
cried scornfully: &ldquo;Is this the great skill in drinking
of which you boasted so freely? The emptying of
this horn should be but child&rsquo;s play; but perhaps
the mighty Thor is weary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the horn,&rdquo; roared the angry god, who
was raging inwardly at having to endure these taunts.
So a third time Thor drank; and when he stopped
to take breath, he threw the horn aside, not waiting
to look down into it, for he felt certain that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
could not be a drop left in it. But one of the giants
caught it up and showed him how much of the
liquid still remained. Enraged at this unexpected
humiliation, Thor refused to drink any longer, and
would barely listen when Utgard-Loke asked him if
he would engage in any trial of strength. &ldquo;We will
propose a game which is a favourite pastime among
our children, so the defender of Asgard will be able
to do the thing with ease. It is merely to lift my
cat from the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words so infuriated Thor that he strode
angrily out of the hall, but before he had gone far,
he encountered a huge bunch of bristling fur that
effectively barred his way. His first impulse was to
strike the cat with his hammer, but remembering
Utgard-Loke&rsquo;s insulting words, he grasped the great
creature by the middle, intending to throw it aside.
But though he tried with all the strength of his
powerful arm to move the cat, he could not stir it
from its place; and the higher he sought to lift it,
the higher it arched its back without ever raising
one foot from the ground. Thor&rsquo;s arm was now
lifted as high as it would go, but he could not budge
the great cat an inch. So at last he let go his hold
and turned to meet the scornful laughter of the whole
company of giants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the strength we have been taught to
fear?&rdquo; cried Utgard-Loke. &ldquo;Surely the gods do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
not call so puny a fellow as this the defender of
Asgard. Perhaps Thor is only mocking us, however,
and will prove his boasted strength in some
worthier contest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a chance to wrestle with the strongest
giant among you, and I will soon show you whether
my strength can be scorned!&rdquo; cried Thor, who was
longing to hurl his hammer at the king&rsquo;s head and
make him cease his insulting words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your boasting has all been idle,&rdquo; said Utgard-Loke,
looking sternly at the angry god, &ldquo;so I will
not match you against our strongest men. But
here comes my old nurse, Ellie, and you may try a
wrestle with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor looked around as a shrivelled old woman,
bent and toothless, hobbled feebly into the hall.
Her sightless eyes seemed to blink with an almost
supernatural intelligence as she made her way
straight toward the spot where the god was standing.
&ldquo;Do not scorn to wrestle with old Ellie,&rdquo; cried the
king, &ldquo;for she has got the better of many a strong
man before now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Thor grasped the hag firmly and tried to throw
her to the ground, but she gripped his body with her
thin arms and clung to him with such amazing
strength that he had to exert all his force to keep
from being strangled. The more he struggled, the
tighter grew the old woman&rsquo;s hold, and even his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
arm which held the hammer was rendered useless by
her vise-like grip. He felt himself slowly weakening,
and soon one knee was on the ground. Then the
hag loosed her hold, and, with a mocking laugh,
hobbled out of the hall.</p>

<p>Thor rose up, ashamed and humiliated by this
last defeat; but the anger had died out of his eyes,
and he stood before Utgard-Loke with bent head.
No one had ever seen the strongest of the gods so
humbled. Then the king smiled upon him kindly
and said, &ldquo;Let us forget both our pride and our
foolish boasting, and share the feast as friends; for
we will now offer you the best of food and drink that
there is in the land of J&ouml;tunheim.&rdquo; So a bountiful
meal was spread before them; and, in the friendly
hospitality of the king, Thor forgot the insults which
he had lately received at Utgard-Loke&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>The next morning the king accompanied his
guests to the gates of the city; and when they were
well outside the walls he said to Thor: &ldquo;Now that
you are no longer within our gates, I will confess to
you that during your brief stay among us, we have
been not only amazed but terrified at seeing how
great indeed is your strength. We know now that
all our combined forces would have been powerless
against you unless we had deceived you by our
magic arts. For it was not superior skill or strength
that defeated you in the contests, but enchantment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
It was I whom you met in the forest,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and when I
found how terrible was Thor&rsquo;s strength, I knew that
it was rash to admit such a foe within our gates
unless he could be deceived by magic, and his strength
be met by cunning. I tied the sack with a cord that
no one but myself could possibly undo, for every
knot was made under a magic spell. Each time
Thor struck me those terrific blows, I quickly slid
a mountain between myself and the hammer; and
you may now see the deep clefts which those blows
have made. When Thialfi ran with Hugi, it was
against Thought that he was racing; and when
Loki strove with Logi, his opponent was none other
than Fire, who consumes whatever he touches. Thor
took such deep draughts from the horn that we were
all amazed at his wonderful drinking; but the other
end of the horn was in the sea, so try as he would he
could never drain it dry. You will notice, however,
as you look over the earth, that the level of the ocean
has fallen far beyond its lowest ebb-line, owing to
Thor&rsquo;s enormous drinking. The cat which could not
be raised from the ground was really the Midgard
serpent, and we giants trembled, indeed, when we saw
how high Thor lifted it. Lastly the old nurse, Ellie,
whose strength seemed so marvellous to you, was not
a woman, but Old Age itself; and in her hold even
the greatest warrior is bound to weaken and fall.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p>
<a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_29_29">[29]</a></span>
Utgard-Loke had told Thor that his name was Skrymer. <a href="#FNanchor_29_29">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
When Thor heard these words of Utgard-Loke&rsquo;s,
he was so furious at the trickery that had been put
upon him that he rushed at the speaker with upraised
hammer. But before the blow could fall, the giant
had disappeared; and when Thor looked about him
he no longer saw the gates of Utgard nor any sight
of the great city. He and Loki were standing on
one of the bleak moorlands over which the winds of
J&ouml;tunheim blew forever night and day.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>The Wooing of Gerd</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE god Freyr was busy enough in the summertime
when the sun shone upon the earth and
everything bloomed and blossomed under his
untiring care; but when winter came there was no
work for him to do in orchards or meadows, and he
grew restless from the long enforced idleness. So
one day when Odin was away on some necessary
journey, Freyr strolled idly through the golden streets
of Asgard, and wished that he might sometime be
taken as a companion when Odin went wandering
among the dwellings of men. He wondered whether
there was any spot in Asgard from which he could
look down and see what was going on in the earth,
and the longing grew very strong to see where Odin
had gone.</p>

<p>There was one place which commanded a view
of all the world, but Freyr did not dare to think of
usurping it, for Odin&rsquo;s throne was held so sacred that
no other god had ever ventured to set foot there.
Dismissing this thought from his mind, Freyr wandered
restlessly about from one marble hall to another,
but getting nearer each moment to the great
gold throne, until at last he stood directly before it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
A long time he hesitated, thinking of the punishment
that might fall upon him if Odin suddenly returned;
but finally the desire to see all the kingdoms
of the earth grew too strong to be resisted, and
Freyr boldly stepped into Odin&rsquo;s sacred seat.</p>

<p>He gave a gasp of wonder and delight as his eyes
travelled quickly over the wonderful panorama of
earth and sky that lay spread out before him. Far
away to the north stretched ice-encircled J&ouml;tunheim,
whose snow-capped mountains reached up into the
clouds. Still farther away lay the Land of Mists
with its chill fogs, reaching out toward Muspelheim.
The earth itself, which Freyr knew so well, looked
wonderfully fresh and new when seen from this
exalted place; and he felt that he himself would
never weary of watching over the affairs of men, if
only he could occupy Odin&rsquo;s seat.</p>

<p>He did not care to rest his gaze very long on
frozen J&ouml;tunheim, for there was nothing in that
dreary country to attract the beauty-loving Freyr;
but as he chanced to look at a tall old castle standing
on the top of one of the wind-swept hills, he saw the
door suddenly open. Then a maiden appeared on
the threshold, and Freyr gazed upon her with surprise
and delight, for she seemed too beautiful to
belong to the grim race of giants.</p>

<p>She stood a moment in the doorway, a very embodiment
of warmth and youth and light; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
the doors at length closed behind her, Freyr felt
that all the brightness had gone out of the world.
Never before had he seen any maiden whom he wished
to make his wife; but here in the land of the frost-giants
he had found one whose loveliness already
made him thrill at the mere thought of her.</p>

<p>He descended slowly and sadly from Odin&rsquo;s throne,
and began to wander aimlessly about Asgard, more
restless and unhappy than before he had taken that
unfortunate glance toward J&ouml;tunheim. For many
days he roamed through the marble-pillared halls,
seeking some distraction to make him forget the
golden-haired maiden whom he loved; but always
his thoughts turned toward the castle on the wind-swept
hill, and he longed&mdash;till he grew sick with
longing&mdash;for a sight of the giant&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>One day his trusted servant Skirner asked him
why he looked so sad; so Freyr told him of his
longing for the golden-haired maiden, and of how
he had watched her from Odin&rsquo;s throne. Then
Skirner offered to make the journey into J&ouml;tunheim
at once, and do his best to woo the giant&rsquo;s daughter
for his master. So Freyr gave him his swiftest
horse, and filled his hands with rich gifts, and finally
girded upon Skirner his own sword, which he promised
to give to the wearer if the mission should be
successful. Then he bade Skirner ride with all
speed northward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
As fast as the faithful horse could carry him,
Skirner hurried toward the giants&rsquo; country; and
when the setting sun threw the long, black shadows
of the hills across the snow-covered ground, he
crossed the last of the fiords that lay at the edge of
J&ouml;tunheim. Then a short, hard gallop over the
frozen ground brought him to the foot of the castle
where the giant Gymer lived with his beautiful
daughter. As he neared the gates, two enormous
dogs sprang at him, barking furiously; and it was
with difficulty that Skirner guided his horse well out
of their reach. Not far away was a shepherd leading
his flock to the scanty pasturage; and Skirner,
riding slowly up to him, asked how he might be able
to enter the castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you seek here?&rdquo; inquired the shepherd.
&ldquo;No stranger ever comes to Gymer&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak with the giant&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo;
replied Skirner.</p>

<p>The shepherd shook his head. &ldquo;It is safer to
have speech with Gymer than with the beautiful
Gerd,&rdquo; he said. Then, looking kindly at the horse
and rider, he added, &ldquo;If you are wise, you will not
go too near the castle gates, but call aloud her name,
and perchance she may come to answer you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Skirner called loudly to the maiden until the
hills re&euml;choed to the name of Gerd; and the giant&rsquo;s
daughter listened to the cry, wondering who the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
stranger might be that would dare to use her name
thus boldly.</p>

<p>Angry, and yet curious to see who stood without
the castle, Gerd threw open the great hall doors;
and at the sight of her the two fierce dogs stopped
howling and lay quiet at her feet. Then Skirner
came boldly to the maiden&rsquo;s side and begged her to
listen to his story. As the laws of hospitality prevailed
even in J&ouml;tunheim, the beautiful Gerd bade
him enter; and when they were seated by a great
fire in the hall, Skirner told the maiden how Freyr
had seen her from Odin&rsquo;s seat and had loved her with
a passion that would surely kill the once-joyous god
unless she consented to become his wife.</p>

<p>Gerd listened coldly to the speaker&rsquo;s words, and
his impassioned pleading left her unmoved. When
Skirner finally spoke of taking her at once with him
to Asgard, she cried angrily, &ldquo;Go back to your master
and tell him that though he should die for love of
me, Gymer&rsquo;s daughter will never wed with one who
is the enemy of her race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Skirner brought out a wonderful ring and
many costly gems&mdash;the gift of Freyr&mdash;and offered
them to Gerd; but she haughtily refused to touch
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot tempt the daughter of Gymer with
gold,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have plenty here in my father&rsquo;s
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
Failing in this, Skirner drew his sword&mdash;the
coveted blade which he hoped to win for himself by
the success of his mission&mdash;and flashing this before
the maiden&rsquo;s eyes he swore by the spear of Odin that
he would kill her if she would not consent to wed with
Freyr. But Gerd only laughed at his threats, and
looked unmoved at the glistening steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your sword to terrify mortal maidens, or
those who sit spinning in the halls of Asgard. The
daughter of Gymer knows no such thing as fear,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>As neither gold nor threats could move the beautiful
Gerd to listen to his master&rsquo;s suit, Skirner tried
his last resource; and, calling upon all the powers
of earth and air and water, he pronounced a terrible
curse upon the maiden for her coldness to the unhappy
Freyr. &ldquo;May the sun never shine without
bringing pestilence upon your land, and may each
day add some trouble to those which already burden
you. May sickness throw its blight upon you, and
loathsome diseases render your beauty hideous.
May old age lay its hand on you before youth is
over, and may you sit lonely and desolate among
your barren hills. May all the good things of life
turn to gnawing pains until you are glad to pray for
death. So shall there be no peace for you in all the
world for having spurned the love of Freyr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first the maiden paid no heed to these fearful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
words; but soon they seemed to weave a sort of
magic spell about her. She trembled, and her beautiful
face grew pale with fear. Suddenly she
stretched out both white arms to Skirner, crying,
&ldquo;Does Freyr indeed love me so deeply that he can
invoke all the powers of the earth to curse me for not
wedding him?&rdquo; Then Skirner told her how great
his master was, and how truly the curse would be
fulfilled if she hardened her heart against the love
of Freyr. And as she listened to the speaker&rsquo;s eager
words of praise, the heart of Gerd was touched and
she gave Skirner her promise to become Freyr&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though,&rdquo; she added sadly, &ldquo;it is strange indeed
for Gymer&rsquo;s daughter to wed with a god.&rdquo; Skirner
tried to persuade her to return with him at once to
Asgard, but she said, &ldquo;Go back to your master and
tell him that I will meet him nine days hence in the
groves of Bar-isle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Skirner mounted his horse again and rode
away from J&ouml;tunheim. Though the journey back
to Asgard was as long and hard as his coming had
been, it seemed to him to be far less wearisome; for
the horse shared his rider&rsquo;s gladness and galloped
more lightly over the frozen ground, and the woods
looked no longer as if peopled with dreadful shapes
and shadows. When Skirner neared Asgard he saw
far in the distance Freyr standing by the rainbow
bridge eagerly watching for his messenger&rsquo;s return.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
The impatient god did not wait, however, until
horse and rider came close enough for him to see
the gladness on Skirner&rsquo;s face; but, believing that
his servant had been unsuccessful, since he rode
alone, Freyr turned sadly away. He did not even
wish to speak with the man who had done him so
great a service; but thought only of the loss of Gerd.</p>

<p>Then Skirner spurred his faithful horse till its
hoofs struck fire from the hard stones beneath; and
when the gates of Asgard were reached, he rushed
eagerly in search of Freyr to tell him of Gerd&rsquo;s
promise. The god&rsquo;s face was lit with a great joy
as he heard that his love was to be rewarded, and
that Gymer&rsquo;s beautiful daughter was willing to become
his wife.</p>

<p>The nine days of waiting seemed very long to
the impatient lover; but at last the time came when
the sun shone as it had never shone before, the
trees blossomed&mdash;although it was still winter&mdash;and
flowers bloomed along the path that led to the groves
of Bar-isle. Then Freyr, full of the glad spirit of
youth and love and springtime, went gayly to the
trysting place; and there beneath the newly leafing
trees stood Gerd, more beautiful by far than when
he had seen her standing in her father&rsquo;s halls.</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a>How Thor Fought the Giant
Hrungner</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day Odin took a long journey into a land
far beyond the seas; and as his road homeward
lay through J&ouml;tunheim, he went with
all speed across that dreary country. With the swiftness
of the wind his wonderful horse Sleipnir carried
him over the ice and snow that lay thick on the
frozen ground; and sometimes, when the mountains
loomed very tall in front of them, the horse
rose into the air, soaring through mist and cloud as
easily as some great bird.</p>

<p>Then as the golden hoofs of Sleipnir struck fire
from the hard rocks that seemed to spring up everywhere
beneath his feet, Odin rejoiced in the strength
and beauty of his horse, for he knew that there was
not its like in all the world. He had almost crossed
the last stretch of treeless country on the edge of
J&ouml;tunheim, when he saw a giant seated on a rock,
with his horse standing idly beside him. As Sleipnir
came rushing by, the giant called out: &ldquo;Ho!
stranger. Why do you ride so swiftly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Odin drew rein and came back to the rock where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
the speaker sat. The giant looked critically at
Sleipnir&rsquo;s splendid head and arching neck; then he
said, &ldquo;That is a fine horse you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no steed that can equal him in beauty
or in swiftness,&rdquo; replied Odin, proudly. The giant
scowled at these boastful words, and replied angrily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, my friend. It is easier to talk than
to prove the truth of one&rsquo;s words. Now my horse
Goldfax is fully as fine as yours; and there is nothing
to match him for speed in the whole land of
J&ouml;tunheim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;J&ouml;tunheim!&rdquo; cried Odin, contemptuously.
&ldquo;What could you expect from such a country as
this? Why, my steed was reared in the sunny
meadows of Asgard, where he still pastures night
and day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever he is, there is no need for us to
waste words in boasting,&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;Let
us run a race and prove whose horse is the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Odin gladly agreed to this; and when the giant
mounted his horse Goldfax, the two riders set off on
a gallop that made the hills re&euml;cho to the sound of
clattering hoofs. Sleipnir, overjoyed at the prospect
of a race with something worth his mettle,
threw back his head and sped like an arrow toward
Asgard. The giant followed close behind, and so
full was he of the excitement of the chase that he was
unaware of being carried within his enemy&rsquo;s gates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
Heimdall, who stood watching by the rainbow bridge,
looked on in surprise as the Ruler of Asgard rushed
swiftly by; and he would have sounded the usual
alarm at the sight of the giant following, if Odin had
not signalled to him to let the strange horse and rider
go past.</p>

<p>When the giant, whose name was Hrungner, found
himself surrounded by so many of those who were
his sworn enemies, he grew fearful and began to
look helplessly about him. Soon he realized, however,
that the laws of hospitality assured every kindness
to a guest, and he knew that he was as safe in
Asgard as he would be in J&ouml;tunheim. So when Odin
summoned him to the feast at Valhalla, Hrungner
sat down to eat and drink with the gods, feeling at
heart very proud to be in the midst of so noble a
company.</p>

<p>As the feast progressed, and the giant drained one
horn after another of the sparkling drink the gods
supplied, he began to grow boastful. He laughed
at the smallness of Odin&rsquo;s shield-hung hall, and told
of the great palaces that were built by the frost-giants.
He boasted loudly of his own great strength;
and as he drank more and more of the wine so freely
poured, he cried: &ldquo;What a puny lot of men you are
to call yourselves gods! There is not a giant in
J&ouml;tunheim who could not beat any one of you in
single combat. If I chose to make so unfair a return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
for your hospitality, I could pull this poor little hall
about your ears, and not leave one stone upon another
in the whole of Asgard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gods grew very angry at these insulting words;
but as Hrungner was their guest, they could not
punish him as he deserved. So the giant continued
drinking; and as his swaggering grew more unbearable,
the gods with difficulty restrained themselves
from striking him dead where he sat. &ldquo;I shall
drink every drop of wine in Asgard before I leave
here,&rdquo; he cried, glaring drunkenly at Odin. &ldquo;Then
I shall pick up a handful of you people that are called
gods, and carry you off to J&ouml;tunheim as playthings
for my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So pleased was the giant with his own wit that he
began to laugh until the cups rattled upon the table.
The gods felt they could not endure his presence
any longer, and determined to hurl him out of Asgard,
even if he was their guest. But Loki, who was
enjoying the giant&rsquo;s boasts and drunken wit, begged
them not to act too hastily; so Hrungner kept on
drinking unmolested. Suddenly he threw his cup
with a crash to the ground, and, looking insolently
around at the company, cried, &ldquo;The gods have always
been the enemies of the frost-giants; but soon I
will drive them from their lofty place, and take Sif
and Freya to be my servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This insulting speech was more than the gods could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
bear; so they called upon Thor to rid them of the
braggart in any way he desired. Then Hrungner
saw the wrathful face of the god approaching, and
saw, too, the upraised hammer; but he was too full
of drunken courage to feel afraid. Before Mj&ouml;lner
fell, he roared savagely at Thor: &ldquo;If I had my shield
and flint stone here, you would not dare to come at
me with your wonderful hammer. It is very brave
of you to strike an unprotected guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words Thor&rsquo;s arm dropped to his side,
and the giant gave a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let this mighty fighter meet me in single combat
on the plains of J&ouml;tunheim, and then I will prove
that the frost-giants are stronger than any of the
timid dwellers in Asgard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor was only too ready to accept the challenge,
and arranged to meet the giant on a certain plain in
J&ouml;tunheim.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Then Hrungner, who felt that there
was nothing more for him to do or say in Asgard,
took his departure; and, returning to his own
country, spread the news that there was to be a
mighty combat between himself and Thor. The
giants did not feel very certain of Hrungner&rsquo;s victory
over the god, so they decided to help him in every
possible way. They made a huge giant out of clay
and stood him on the plain where the battle was to
be fought, hoping by this stratagem to deceive Thor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
As there was no human heart to put into the clay
giant,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> they gave him a mare&rsquo;s heart, and this made
the poor creature so timid that he could barely be
induced to stand still on the plain and await Thor&rsquo;s
coming.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_30_30">[30]</a></span>
The plain was called Grjotlungard. <a href="#FNanchor_30_30">Back</a></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_31_31">[31]</a></span>
The clay giant was named Mokkerkalfe. <a href="#FNanchor_31_31">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Beside the newly made giant stood Hrungner with
his shield and flintstone, secretly hoping that Thor
would mistake the clay figure for that of his opponent,
and so spend the first force of his blows on
the mock giant&rsquo;s head. Suddenly on the crest of
the mountain appeared a runner; and soon Thor&rsquo;s
servant, Thialfi, came speeding toward them. He
called loudly to Hrungner: &ldquo;My master is on his
way to meet you; but he will not follow on the road
I came. He is coming along underground, and will
attack you from beneath.&rdquo; The stupid giant believed
this; so he threw his shield on the ground
and stood firmly upon it, with the flintstone in his
hand, ready to strike Thor&rsquo;s head the moment it
emerged.</p>

<p>Soon there came a sudden roaring sound as if all
the waters of the earth were rushing to pour themselves
into the sea; the sky darkened, and through
the thick clouds the lightning gleamed and flashed
over the darkening plain. Nearer and nearer came
the crashing of thunder which heralded Thor&rsquo;s approach,
and the hills answered with long, deep peals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
Then on the brow of the hill overlooking the plain
appeared Thor&rsquo;s majestic figure, so terrible to behold
that most of the giants fled away in fear. With
incredible swiftness he rushed upon Hrungner, and
the hammer&mdash;whirled through the air by his mighty
arm&mdash;flew straight at the giant&rsquo;s head. The terrific
force of the blow hurled Hrungner at once to
the ground, but not before he had thrown his flintstone
at Thor&rsquo;s forehead.</p>

<p>The noise of the combat was like the crashing of
many mountains together. Hrungner fell to the
ground like an oak tree that has received the last
stroke of the axe; and, as he fell, Thialfi sprang at the
clay giant and disposed of him with one straight
blow. The flintstone which Hrungner had thrown,
sank into Thor&rsquo;s forehead; and the sudden pain
made him so dizzy that he staggered forward and
fell just where Hrungner&rsquo;s great body lay stretched
upon the ground. Then Thor found to his dismay
that one of the giant&rsquo;s feet was resting firmly on his
neck; and, try as he would, he could not get free.
So he bade Thialfi bring his little Magne, who was
only three days old, and when the child came, he
easily lifted the great foot from his father&rsquo;s neck.
Thor was very proud of this display of strength,
and he wished to give his son the giant&rsquo;s horse Goldfax,
but Odin would not permit the gift.</p>

<p>The frost-giants were discouraged over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
complete defeat of their champion, but they took great
satisfaction in seeing the flintstone which Hrungner
had driven into Thor&rsquo;s forehead. When the Thunderer
returned to Asgard he found that the stone
caused him much pain, and there seemed to be no way
to remove it. So he sent for the sorceress Groa,
who, as soon as she came, began to weave her magic
spells, and chant weird songs, and Thor felt the stone
in his head already beginning to loosen. While
Groa continued her incantations, and the pain in
his head grew less and less each moment, Thor tried
to think of some way in which he could reward his
benefactress for her kindness. Orvandel, Groa&rsquo;s
husband, had been for many years away from his
home; and as the sorceress loved him very dearly,
there was nothing she wished for so much as his
return. Thor was partly responsible for her husband&rsquo;s
disappearance, for Orvandel had once angered
him so that he had put the offender into a
basket and carried him to a far-off country, where
he left the unfortunate man to find his way back
alone. During the journey the air was so cold that
poor Orvandel nearly perished in his narrow prison.
As it was, one of his toes which protruded from the
basket really did freeze; and this made Thor so
ashamed of his harsh treatment of Orvandel that he
set the prisoner free. Then he placed his toe in the
sky as a star, and in the northern heavens there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
bright constellation which is still known as Orvandel&rsquo;s
Toe.</p>

<p>When Thor told Groa what he had done, and
promised to bring her husband back to her at once,
the sorceress became so overjoyed at the prospect of
Orvandel&rsquo;s return that she forgot all her magic arts
and spells. Full of happiness at the thought of
seeing her husband, she suddenly stopped her weird
singing, and was unable to resume it, though Thor
begged her to continue the enchantment until the
stone was loosed. But Groa had lost all her mystic
power, and could never charm things from their
place again. So the flintstone remained in Thor&rsquo;s
forehead, and in the far-off countries of the north,
the children are taught not to throw any stone too
hard upon the floor, for when it strikes the ground
the flint in Thor&rsquo;s forehead moves, and causes the
god much pain.</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>The Story of Balder</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N all the city of Asgard there was no god so
beautiful or so dearly loved as Balder. Wherever
he went it was like the coming of sunshine,
and every grief fled away before the brightness
of his presence. In all his happy life he had
never known a moment&rsquo;s sadness, and the gods believed
that none could ever come to him. So beautiful
and joyous and free from care was Balder that
he seemed to the gods to be the one among them
who could surely never share in the final doom which
they knew awaited all the dwellers in Asgard.</p>

<p>The days passed happily for Balder,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and no
thought of sorrow crossed his untroubled mind,
until one night he had a dream which filled him with
strange fear. When the gods met again in council
he told them his dream, and begged them to interpret
its meaning. They tried to laugh and banish
his fears, but at heart they felt that an evil day had
come. Over Asgard now hung a dark shadow which
foreboded the coming sorrow, for the dream spoke of
approaching evil, even of death. So full of sadness

did the gods become at the thought of losing Balder,
that they cared no longer to join in their accustomed
games or to make merry while some tragic fate might
be overshadowing the bright and joyous youth.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_32_32">[32]</a></span>
Balder&rsquo;s palace was named Breidablik. <a href="#FNanchor_32_32">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Odin could not rest until he learned the truth
about his favourite son; so he mounted Sleipnir and
rode down to the dark region where the goddess Hel
ruled over her innumerable dead. In those silent
halls<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> he found a table spread, and dishes of gold
and silver were set out as if for some honoured guest.
At the head of the table was one vacant seat; and
when Odin saw this, his heart sank with fear, for he
knew too well for whom the chair was waiting.
Hoping against hope, in spite of this sinister sight,
Odin returned to the earth and sought out a certain
wood where a famous prophetess had long ago been
buried. Over her grave he uttered some mystic
words that roused the sleeper from her age-long rest,
and at last she spoke in a faint, far-off voice. &ldquo;Who
is it that comes to break my sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_33_33">[33]</a></span>
Hel&rsquo;s palace was called Eliudnir. <a href="#FNanchor_33_33">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>And Odin answered, &ldquo;I am Voltam, and I have
come to ask why the table is so richly spread in
Helheim and for whom the vacant chair stands
waiting.&rdquo; Thus Odin spoke, for he feared to tell
her his name.</p>

<p>A silence fell over the dim old forest, and for a
moment Odin feared that his spells could not compel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
the dead to speak. But at last a faint voice whispered,
&ldquo;It is for the shining Balder that Hel and all
her hosts are waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who then shall send the Beloved of the gods to
Helheim?&rdquo; asked Odin, and he waited fearfully for
the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blind H&ouml;der shall slay him, for so it has been
written, and so it shall be,&rdquo; came the words which
the anxious listener dreaded and yet waited to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who shall avenge the death of Balder?&rdquo; he
asked sorrowfully. For a long time no answer came;
then the voice, which sounded still farther away,
cried mournfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep me no longer from my well-earned rest.
For ages upon ages I have lain here, and the rain and
snow have beat upon my head and the winds have
sung their songs in my ears. Depart thou hence
and leave me to my sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Odin left the forest, for he knew that the dead
would speak no more; and slowly and sorrowfully
he returned to Asgard. He did not tell the gods of
his visit to Helheim; but kept to himself the sad
knowledge he had gained.</p>

<p>Meantime the goddess Frigga determined to
avert, if possible, the unknown danger that threatened
her son; so she went out one day from her
palace and wandered over the whole earth. And
as she went she begged everything which she met to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
swear by a solemn oath never to hurt Balder. Fire,
water, rocks, trees, iron, brass, birds and beasts,&mdash;all
were bound by a vow to do no harm to him; and
everything on earth gave the promise gladly, for
all the world loved the bright and joyous Balder.
As Frigga was returning home, she saw just outside
the gates of Asgard a small plant called the mistletoe;
but it looked so harmless that she passed it by without
asking for the promise, and hurried on to tell
Odin of the success of her journey.</p>

<p>When the gods heard how everything had sworn
never to hurt Balder, there was gladness again among
them. But Odin, knowing the decree of the Norns,
could not rejoice with the rest; though in the general
happiness that reigned now in Asgard, no one marked
his sadness. Then, to prove whether all the things
which had given the promise would really keep their
word to Frigga, the gods placed the youth as a target
before them, and hurled at him huge stones and
sharp-pointed spears and the weapons which they
used in battle; but each missile turned aside, and
refused to hurt the shining Balder. Even the
deadly battle-axes fell harmless at his feet. Now
Loki, who always hated everything beautiful, and
who was jealous of Balder because the gods loved
him, stood by watching the game. His heart was
full of bitterness and envy, and he hated the glorious
youth who could be so confident and secure in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
love which all the world had owned for him. So he
determined to work some harm to Balder.</p>

<p>One day a strange old woman came to the palace
of Frigga and asked to have speech with her. The
goddess was sitting with her maidens spinning, and
when the old woman was admitted to her presence,
she spoke to her kindly and asked the object of her
visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come, lady,&rdquo; said the old woman, who
was really Loki in disguise, &ldquo;to learn what is going
on here in Asgard that the shouts of joy reach even
to the earth. I hear laughter and cheering in the
court where the gods are at their games. Tell me,
what does it mean?&rdquo; Then Frigga smiled happily
and said, &ldquo;It means that the gods are hurling their
battle-axes at Balder and trying to wound him,
but he stands before them unhurt, for everything
on earth has sworn to me to do him no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has everything indeed made you this promise?&rdquo;
asked Loki.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Frigga; &ldquo;everything except a
little plant called the mistletoe, and this looked so
small and weak that I did not ask it to promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does this mistletoe grow far from here?&rdquo;
continued the pretended old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just at the gates of Asgard,&rdquo; answered Frigga.
And Loki, having learned what he wished, left the
palace exulting in the ease with which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
deceived the unsuspecting goddess. Laying aside his
disguise, he sought the place where the mistletoe
grew, and cutting off a branch, he shaped it into an
arrow. Then he went to join the gods in their
sport.</p>

<p>Just outside the circle of the players stood H&ouml;der,
the brother of Balder, silent and alone, for he was
blind and could not share in the games. Going up
to him, Loki said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you not join in the sport, H&ouml;der, and
throw some missile at the wonderful Balder who now
bears a charmed life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot see where he is standing,&rdquo;
answered H&ouml;der, &ldquo;and besides, I have no weapon
to throw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said Loki, &ldquo;come with me and I
will give you an arrow and help you shoot it.&rdquo; So
he led H&ouml;der forward, and the blind god followed
him willingly, for he dreamed of no evil.</p>

<p>Then Loki put the arrow into his hand and directed
his aim so well that the fatal shaft flew straight to
Balder&rsquo;s heart, and in a moment the beautiful god
lay dead.</p>

<p>There was mourning now in Asgard, and over
all the world. The sun no longer shone with its
accustomed brightness; the birds stopped their
singing, and the flowers drooped their heads; even
the beasts felt the sadness that lay upon the earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
and crouched silent in their dens. Everything that
loved the shining Balder now wept and mourned
for him. Then the gods arrayed his body in the
finest cloth of gold, and brought it down to the sea,
where Balder&rsquo;s ship<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> lay close to the water&rsquo;s edge.
Very sadly they laid the body upon its deck, and
heaped around the beloved form rings and chains
of finest gold, jewels and weapons such as warriors
love. When Nanna, Balder&rsquo;s wife, saw the body
wrapped in readiness for burning, her heart broke
from her great grief, and the gods laid her, dead,
beside her husband.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_34_34">[34]</a></span>
The name of the ship was Ringhorn. <a href="#FNanchor_34_34">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then they lit the funeral fires with a thorn-twig,
which is the emblem of sleep; and took their last
look at the dead Balder as he lay upon the burning
pyre. Odin, stepping forward, whispered in the
unhearing ear of his son; but what he said no one
ever knew.</p>

<p>When they tried to launch the ship, they found
to their dismay that it was too heavily laden for
their united efforts. So they sent for the mountain-giantess
Hyrroken&mdash;who had ever been friendly
to the people of Asgard&mdash;and begged her to grant
this last service to the beloved of the gods. The
giantess came, riding on a fierce wolf, with twisted
snakes in her hands for reins. She gladly offered
her help to the gods, and putting her shoulder to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
the prow, she gave it a mighty shove which sent the
burning ship far out from the shore.</p>

<p>The flames rose higher and higher as the vessel
drifted out toward the sea, bearing with it the light
and joy of Asgard. A silence fell on all the watchers,
and great sorrow filled their hearts. All the world
seemed under a shadow, and in the solemn stillness
no sound was heard but the roaring of the flames
on the burning ship. The gods stood upon the
shore watching the funeral pyre, and, mingled with
their sadness, was a dread foreboding of evil; for
outside the ring of the shining ones of Asgard was
another group of watchers&mdash;the frost-giants&mdash;who
seemed to be looking on in mockery at the solemn
rites, and now and then drew nearer, their tall forms
looming up grim and threatening and terrible.</p>

<p>Then the sea and sky seemed to burst into one
mass of glowing flame and a wonderful golden light
spread over the earth as the fire upon the slowly
moving ship burned each moment more brightly.
Thus the vessel drifted westward toward the sea,
and the gods knew that Balder had passed forever
from their sight.</p>

<p>One by one they returned sadly to Asgard; but
Odin could not give up his son without one last
effort to reclaim him. He determined to go himself
to Helheim, and offer a ransom to the goddess Hel
if she would give Balder back to him. Meantime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
poor blind H&ouml;der had been mourning over the great
evil which he had innocently wrought, and he wished
with all the fervor of his loving heart that he could
bring Balder back to Asgard. Sadly he sought the
palace of his mother Frigga, and asked her whether
he might not go to Helheim and offer his life to the
dread goddess in exchange for Balder&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The road
is long and hard to find,&rdquo; said Frigga, &ldquo;and what
could a blind god do in the path where the best
traveller would lose his way? Go back to your own
dwelling, and send for Hermod, our swift messenger.
He loved the shining Balder and now mourns for
him. Bid him ride to Helheim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>H&ouml;der did as his mother commanded, and found
Hermod only too willing to take the fearful journey
for the sake of Balder. Odin gave him his own horse
Sleipnir, who up to this time had never allowed
another rider to mount him. Nine days and nights
Hermod rode through the earth in darkness so thick
that his horse could not see where to step. It was
a black and steep and fearful road down to Helheim,
and only on Odin&rsquo;s horse could the journey have
been made. On the tenth morning he came to the
golden bridge that spanned the river Gi&ouml;ll; and
here a maiden,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> pale and sorrowful, kept guard.
She halted Hermod as he rode across the bridge,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_35_35">[35]</a></span>
Her name was Modgud. <a href="#FNanchor_35_35">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who are you, and what do you seek here among
the dead? Yesterday five hands of men rode across
the bridge, but they did not shake it as you alone
have done. Your face is not as the face of the
dead. Why do you come here? It is no place for
the living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hermod asked if she had seen the shining
Balder pass over her bridge; and the maiden
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has crossed it already, and has gone to the
dark hall where the feast is now spread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Hermod rode on until he reached Hel&rsquo;s gloomy
palace and came face to face with the terrible queen
who ruled over the kingdom of the dead. Hermod
trembled with fear as he looked about him, but his
love for Balder gave him courage, and he stepped up
boldly before the goddess, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to beg a boon of thee, O Hel. Your
land is full without the shining Balder, and Asgard
is empty and lonely since he has gone. Every heart
mourns for him, and every eye is filled with tears.
Give him back to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly and sternly Hel replied: &ldquo;Is there indeed
no dry eye upon the earth? If it be true as thou
sayest, that everything weeps for Balder, he shall
return to Asgard; but if there is one who will not
weep, he shall stay forever in Helheim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hermod hurried with the message back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
Asgard, and when Odin heard the answer Hel had
made, he gave the command, and everything upon
the earth wept and mourned for Balder. Throughout
the whole world arose the sound of bitter wailing;
and not a single eye remained undimmed by
tears. But among the mourners in Asgard there
was one old woman<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> whom Odin spied standing
apart and shedding no tear.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_36_36">[36]</a></span>
Loki disguised himself as the giantess Thok. <a href="#FNanchor_36_36">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Weep,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;weep for Balder that he may
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the old woman, &ldquo;I will not weep.
He has done naught for me that I should mourn
him. Let him stay in Helheim.&rdquo; Then with a
mocking laugh she hurried away, and Odin knew
that it was Loki.</p>

<p>So Balder never came back to Asgard.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>Andvari&rsquo;s Hoard</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE Odin and H&oelig;nir and Loki went on a visit
to the earth, and in order to mingle freely with
people without being recognized as gods, they
laid aside all their divine powers and became, even
in appearance, like ordinary men. When they had
wandered about the earth many days, and talked
with many people,&mdash;who never knew, of course,
that the gods were among them,&mdash;they grew tired
of the busy life of the world, and longed to find
some place of quiet and rest. So they went far
into the heart of the forest, and sat down beside a
brook where many fish were leaping about and darting
through the sparkling water. The gods lay
idly upon the grass and watched them for a long
time. Presently, they spied an otter sitting on
the bank of the stream, lazily eating a fish which
he had just caught. The gods looked on at the
meal, and it made them remember that they too
were hungry. Odin therefore proposed that they
journey on in search of food, and to this the others
readily consented; but as they rose to go, Loki
suddenly took up a large stone, and, throwing it
at the otter, killed him instantly. At this wanton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
cruelty Odin became angry, and rebuked Loki for
his act<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; but Loki only laughed, while he skinned
the otter and cast its body back into the stream.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_37_37">[37]</a></span>
The otter was held sacred by the Norsemen, and it figures
in the myths of many races. Even to-day the killing of an otter
is considered a great crime by the Parsees. <a href="#FNanchor_37_37">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The gods then wandered on until almost nightfall
before they came to any dwelling, and this was
only a rude hut built on the side of a mountain.
But they were too weary to look further, so they
stopped to beg food and a lodging for the night.
The old man<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> who lived in the hut bade them enter
and share his simple fare, and in return he asked
them to tell him of their adventures. Without
revealing their identity, Odin told him of their
wanderings among men, and of the strange things
they had seen. H&oelig;nir also related many stories;
but his were of brave heroes who had wrought the
mightiest deeds on bloody battlefields. When it
came Loki&rsquo;s turn, they asked him to tell all he knew
of the life lived by the bright dwellers in Asgard, but
Loki laughed and threw upon the ground his otter&rsquo;s
skin. When the old man saw this, he cried out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_38_38">[38]</a></span>
The old man&rsquo;s name was Hreidmar (Rodmar). <a href="#FNanchor_38_38">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;O wicked, cruel man, you have killed my son.
He was fishing to-day in the stream, and at this
sport he always takes the form of an otter. Alas,
this is indeed he, and you have slain him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
Then he raised a loud cry, and called for help
to his two sons, Fafnir and Regin, who came running
in from the woods near by. As soon as they
heard of the killing of their brother, they seized
the three gods and bound them hand and foot,
for, in becoming men, the gods had lost all their
divine powers, and they had no choice but to yield.</p>

<p>When Odin begged the old man to ask whatever
he would in payment for their ransom, both Fafnir
and Regin demanded the life of one of the gods in
return for their brother&rsquo;s. But their father spread
the otter&rsquo;s skin upon the ground, and, turning to
Odin, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and your wicked companions shall be free
when you have covered every hair of this hide
with a piece of gold or a precious stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will do this,&rdquo; answered Odin; &ldquo;but first
you must set one of us free that he may go and procure
the treasure. Let the other two stay bound as
hostages until he returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this the old man and his sons agreed, and
Odin bade them unbind Loki, for he alone would
know where to find such vast treasure as they needed.
Accordingly Loki was freed, and promising his
companions to return with their ransom, he hurried
away. There was only one place where a hoard
of gold and precious stones might be found, and
thither Loki directed his steps. There were many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
mountains to climb and rivers to cross before he
reached the place he sought, and night coming on
made the journey more difficult and wearisome.</p>

<p>At last he spied upon a rocky mountain side the
thing he had come so far to find, a small, deep cavern
in the rocks. As Loki drew nearer, the moonlight
revealed a little brook gushing from the mouth of
the cavern and winding in and out among the rocks
below. It was small, but beautifully clear, and the
pebbles in its bed shone in the moonlight like diamonds.
Just where it issued from the cave, the
water flowed swiftly over a deep pool, and here it
was so dark that only the sharp eyes of Loki could
have caught the faint shimmer of a salmon which
lay lurking in its depths.</p>

<p>Loki saw it, however, and his heart leaped for joy,
for this salmon was no other than the cunning dwarf
Andvari, the owner of a wonderful hoard of gold
and gems. The treasure was buried somewhere
near the cavern, and it was to gain this glittering
hoard that Loki had come so far. So he now put
forth all his skill to catch the wily salmon as it darted
to and fro in the stream. The dwarf knew, however,
who the fisherman was, and why he had come,
and he had no intention of being caught and made
to yield up his treasures. Loki spent many hours
trying to lure the salmon into the shallows, but all
his efforts were in vain. The crafty fish never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
moved from his deep, dark pool. Then Loki saw
that further attempts would be useless unless he had
help from some one with magic skill, so he determined
to seek the aid of Queen Ran and her wonderful
net.</p>

<p>Leaving the cave, he hurried down to the sea,
and for many hours he walked along the shore,
searching carefully among the rocks for the hiding
place of the cruel ocean queen. Somewhere here,
or upon the jagged reefs, he would be sure to find
her spreading a net for her prey. But though
he wandered for miles along the water&rsquo;s edge, he
caught no glimpse of her anywhere; and, wearied
and disheartened, he was about to give up his
search, when he heard a low, rippling laugh just
behind him, and turning he saw the beautiful
daughters of the sea-king seated on the rocks combing
their golden hair. Loki went over to them
and begged them to tell him where he could find
their mother, Queen Ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you seek her?&rdquo; one of the maidens asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am a fisherman, and would like to ask
her where the big fish are gathering now,&rdquo; replied
Loki.</p>

<p>The sea-maidens laughed again and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O crafty, cunning Loki, do not think to deceive
us who know well who you are, and why
you have come hither. Play no tricks, then, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
tell no lies to our mother, or you will not gain the
object of your journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loki promised, and begged the nymphs to tell
him where to find Queen Ran, since no other than
Odin himself needed her help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go about ten miles farther,&rdquo; answered
one of the maidens, &ldquo;until you come to a
place where the rocks are high, and project in sharp,
dangerous reefs far out into the sea. Here the waves
dash with tremendous fury, and here is many a
good ship wrecked and all her cargo lost. Look
among the shadows of the rocks, and you will find
our mother sitting there mending her net.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loki thanked the nymphs and hurried on, for
the night was growing black and the moon was
completely hidden, and he had yet far to go. When
he felt sure that ten miles lay between him and the
daughters of the sea, he stopped and looked carefully
about him. Near by was a group of tall,
jagged rocks over which the waves dashed with
great force; but there was one spot so protected
that even the spray from the water did not reach it,
and here Loki spied Queen Ran, long-fingered,
greedy and cruel, mending her magic net. When
she saw Loki, she tried to hide in the shadow of the
rocks, for she knew him and feared he had come with
some unfriendly message from Odin. But Loki
called to her and said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
&ldquo;Be not afraid, O Queen, for I come as a petitioner
to beg a great boon of thee;&rdquo; and Ran replied,
&ldquo;What does Loki wish, that he leaves the
shining halls of Asgard to travel over the earth
to speak to the wife of &AElig;ger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have journeyed thus far,&rdquo; answered Loki,
&ldquo;because I have heard of your wonderful net.
They say that it will catch whatever you wish, and
that anything once caught cannot escape from its
magic meshes. Therefore I have come to ask your
help, for there is a certain salmon which I have long
tried to snare, but which is too cunning to be caught
by ordinary means. Lend me, I beg, your magic
net.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot! I cannot!&rdquo; cried Ran, &ldquo;there is a
ship sailing hither which will reach these rocks in
the morning, and it is full of great treasure&mdash;jewels,
and gold, and rich apparel. I have sent
my mermaids to lure it to the reefs, where it will
be dashed to pieces, and the prize be gathered into
my net. No, I cannot lend it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But let me have it for just one hour,&rdquo; pleaded
Loki, &ldquo;and I will promise to return it in that time.
I swear it on the word of a god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The oath was reassuring, but still Ran hesitated
to let the precious net leave her hands. At length,
however, she was persuaded, and with many expressions
of gratitude, Loki said good-by and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
hastened back to the cave of Andvari, for the night was
now far spent, and at daylight the salmon would
be sure to leave his haunts.</p>

<p>When he reached the cavern, the fish was still
lying idly in the water, but upon seeing the net in
Loki&rsquo;s hand it darted like a flash down the stream.
Then Loki quickly cast his net, and though the
cunning fish swam with wonderful swiftness, it
could not escape the magic net which began to
close slowly and surely about it. As soon as Loki
thought that his prize was secure, he drew the net
on land, and, after slowly loosening the meshes,
he at last grasped the struggling fish in his hand.
Now, however, it was no longer a salmon fighting
for its freedom, but the crafty dwarf Andvari.
Any one less wise than Loki would have dropped
him immediately in surprise at the transformation,
but Loki only held on the tighter, and shook the poor
dwarf until he cried for mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mercy will I grant thee, thou master thief,&rdquo;
exclaimed the god, &ldquo;until thou hast revealed to
me the hiding place of thy ill-gotten treasures.
Show me where it lies, or I will dash thee to pieces
upon these rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no hope of escape, Andvari
promised to yield up his hoard, and pointing to
a large rock near by bade Loki raise it and look beneath.
Without loosening his hold of the dwarf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
Loki tried to lift the stone, but though it was far
from being heavy or beyond his strength, he found
that he could not move it. Then he knew that he
was being tricked, and, grasping the dwarf still
tighter, he shook him fiercely and commanded him
to give his help. Andvari laid his finger on the
stone and immediately it turned over and disclosed
a large pit beneath.</p>

<p>It was quite dark now and the moon was completely
hidden; yet even in the dim light Loki saw
the sparkle of thousands of precious gems and the
shimmer of many dazzling heaps of gold. It was
truly a wonderful sight, and would have bewildered
the ordinary finder of such wealth; but Loki had
no time to spend in admiration. He gathered all
the treasure together in the net, which, by its magic
power, grew larger and larger as he continued to
fill it.</p>

<p>The dwarf meanwhile stood by sullen and angry,
watching the gold and gems being poured into the
net. Had it been Odin who was robbing him of his
hoard, he would have begged that some small portion
of it might be left him, but he knew better than to
make such a request of Loki. So when the last of
the treasure had been gathered up, he turned away
and was disappearing into the woods when Loki
caught the glitter of something upon his finger, and
seizing him roughly, cried out: &ldquo;Ho, ho, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
cunning elf. So you would keep back some of the
gems, I see. Yield me that ring upon your finger,
or you shall not have one moment more to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andvari&rsquo;s face grew black with rage, and he
refused to give up his ring, stamping his foot all
the while upon the ground and cursing Loki for his
avarice and greed. Yet he knew too well that his
fury was in vain, and soon he changed his tone, begging
Loki, humbly, to leave him his one poor gem.
This appeal would have moved any other of the
gods, but Loki was never known to do a generous
thing in all his life. He only gave a mocking,
hateful laugh, and, seizing the dwarf, tore the ring
from his finger.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful ring, shaped like a serpent,
coiled, with its tail in its mouth. It had two blood-red
rubies for eyes, and in the dim light they seemed
to Loki to glow with all the cunning and cruelty of
a living serpent. But this did not deter him from
slipping the ring on his finger, and laughing triumphantly
at the dwarf, who was now foaming with helpless
rage. Then Andvari cursed the ring and said:
&ldquo;May this ring be your bane, and the bane of all
who shall possess it. May it bring sorrow and evil
upon him who shall wear it, and from this day be the
source of envy and hatred and bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To these dreadful words Loki paid no heed, and,
throwing his precious burden upon his shoulder, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
hurried down the mountain side and sped swiftly on
to the old man&rsquo;s cottage. Odin and H&oelig;nir were
still bound, and they had almost given up hope
of Loki&rsquo;s return. But they forgot the tediousness
of their captivity when they saw the great heap of
gold and gems which Loki poured out of the net;
for here was surely more than enough to cover ten
otters&rsquo; skins, and the remainder of the treasure
would be their own.</p>

<p>Fafnir and Regin stretched the skin upon the
ground, and bade Loki cover every hair. This
seemed at first an easy thing to do; but the more
gold and precious stones that Loki spread upon it,
the larger the skin seemed to grow, until it covered
the entire floor of the hut; and though Loki still
added handfuls of gold, the brothers always found
some spot uncovered. At last every hair of the
hide was completely hidden beneath some coin or
gem, and the gods demanded their release. The
old man unloosed the cords which bound them and
was bidding them depart, when Regin uttered a
loud cry and declared that there was one hair yet
uncovered upon the otter&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Odin and H&oelig;nir looked at each other in dismay,
for the net was now empty, and there was no way to
procure further treasure. Meanwhile, the old man
and his sons were clamouring loudly for the gods to
fulfil their promise. The case seemed indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
desperate; until Loki drew from his finger the serpent
ring of Andvari, and laid it upon the hair.
The brothers being now satisfied, the gods left
the hut with all speed. Odin and H&oelig;nir returned
at once to Asgard, while Loki took back the net to
Queen Ran, who was anxiously waiting, and reached
her just as the dawn was breaking.</p>

<p>The treasure soon became, according to Andvari&rsquo;s
words, a source of hatred and bloodshed; for the old
man, wishing to keep the wealth for himself, drove his
sons from the house, and shut himself up with his
treasure. All day long he sat poring greedily over
the heap of glittering gems, and running his fingers
through the shining gold. Above all, he loved to
watch the serpent ring, with its glowing ruby eyes.</p>

<p>Then one night Fafnir came suddenly upon him,
demanding his share of the gold; and when the old
man refused to yield up even one stone, Fafnir
slew him in his anger, and took possession of all
the treasure. Soon he grew fearful that his brother
might steal upon him sometime and rob, or perchance
kill him; so he changed himself into a monstrous
dragon which breathed forth fire and spat
deadly poison. Thus secured, he coiled himself
about the hoard, and no one dared to approach
him. Regin meanwhile fled to a neighbouring city,
and became the king&rsquo;s master-smith, the maker of
strong swords.</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>The Story of Siegmund</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE king whose protection Regin sought was
named Alf, and when he learned of the great
skill that belonged to this stranger in his
realm, he gave Regin a place of honour among the
sword-makers, and soon promoted him to be master-smith.
Before many years passed the fame of
Regin&rsquo;s smithy had spread far and wide; for here
men gathered not only to learn the master&rsquo;s craft,
but to share in that wisdom which he seemed to have
gathered from all the ages. Even the noted wise
men of the kingdom came to him, wondering at his
great knowledge; and the king sought his counsel
in all the difficult affairs of state.</p>

<p>At the court of King Alf lived his foster-son Siegfried,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
who was much beloved by the king, although
he was not of his own blood. The youth was tall
and strong, of fearless bearing, and with so keen an
eye that men often quailed before his glance. His
hair was golden red, and fell down in long locks over
his shoulders; and his body was of a strength that
matched the beauty of his face. Men said of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
that &ldquo;never did he lose heart, and of naught was
he afraid.&rdquo; When Siegfried grew to manhood,
King Alf sent him to Regin&rsquo;s smithy that he might
not only profit by the wisdom of this wisest of teachers,
but also be taught to fashion a sword that could
be worthily borne by one of his name and race, for
Siegfried was the last of the Volsungs&mdash;a race of
warriors whose fame was still fresh in the minds of
men.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_39_39">[39]</a></span>
In the Volsunga Saga his name is Sigurd. <a href="#FNanchor_39_39">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>At first Siegfried did not like to wear the woollen
coat and rough leather apron of a smith, for he was
a prince&rsquo;s son and he thought the work menial; but
he soon learned to respect his great teacher so much
that the place took on a new dignity in his eyes and
he no longer chafed at the hard work or the simple
fare he shared with Regin. Early in the morning
the sound of Siegfried&rsquo;s hammer could be heard as
he worked blithely at his trade, and he almost forgot
that he had ever known any other life than this one
by Regin&rsquo;s side. When the long day was over and
he sat with his master by the glowing light of the
forge, Regin would tell him wonderful tales of gods
and heroes and especially of the warrior race from
which Siegfried sprang. Many times they sat until
the last bit of fire in the forge sank into lifeless embers,
and still the youth listened eagerly to the stories
of brave deeds wrought by the long-dead Volsungs.
The story which he never tired of hearing was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
of his own birth, and in this wise did Regin always
begin the tale:&mdash;</p>

<p>There was once a mighty king named Volsung,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
who built a lordly palace such as men never saw
before nor will ever see again; for its walls glistened
with thousands of shields taken from his enemies in
battle, and in the centre of the palace was a large
courtyard in which grew a wonderful tree. This
tree was so high that it towered above the castle
walls, and its branches grew so thick that they
spread like a roof over the whole palace. The king
called this tree Branstock, and about its mighty
trunk the Volsungs gathered to feast and sing songs
in praise of their king and their race.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_40_40">[40]</a></span>
Volsung was the son of Rerir, who was the son of Sigi, the
son of Odin. <a href="#FNanchor_40_40">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Ten sons and one daughter were born to King
Volsung, and of these the great ruler was rightly
proud, for the youths bid fair to excel their kinsmen
in strength and courage, while the daughter, Signy,
was so famed for her beauty that suitors came from
many distant lands. Now there was a certain king
named Siggeir, ruler of the Goths, who wooed the
fair Signy with many rich gifts, all of which the
maiden coldly disdained, for she distrusted his dark,
evil-looking face. King Volsung, however, was
much taken with the wealth of Siggeir and his seeming
generosity, and he urged his daughter to accept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
this giver of rich gifts. For a long time Signy
refused to listen to her father&rsquo;s words, but at length
she yielded and was betrothed to her hated suitor.
Then a great feast was proclaimed throughout the
kingdom, and Siggeir gave freely of his gold. The
wedding banquet was served in the courtyard
beneath the spreading boughs of the mighty Branstock,
and the guests were so many in number that
they well-nigh filled the halls to overflowing.</p>

<p>When the feasting and merriment were at their
highest, there suddenly appeared in the midst of
the revellers a tall old man. He had a blue cloak
thrown over his shoulders, and his beard was long
and white. Only a few of the guests caught a glimpse
of his face, but those who did affirmed that he had
only one eye. Stepping quickly up to King Volsung&rsquo;s
wonderful tree, he drew from beneath his
cloak a gleaming sword and drove it with great
force into the tree trunk, up to the very hilt. Then
turning to the astonished company, he said, &ldquo;Whoso
draweth this sword from the tree shall have it as
a gift from me; and he shall find that he never bore
in his hand a better sword than this.&rdquo; So saying,
the old man went forth from the hall, and none knew
who he was nor whither he went; but some whispered
that it was Odin himself who had been among
them.</p>

<p>Then one by one the guests of King Volsung tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
to draw out the sword, but, though many of them
were strong-armed warriors, not a single man had
the power so much as to loosen it from the tree.
King Siggeir was among the last to try his strength,
and he strove until his eyes almost started from his
head. But he, too, failed as the others had done, and
returned to his place angered and humiliated at his
defeat. When all the guests had been put to the
test, and no one had drawn the sword, a certain lord
said to King Volsung, &ldquo;Have you no more sons?&rdquo;
and the king answered: &ldquo;There is yet one more, but
he is a mere lad. It would be cruel to shame him
before so great a company.&rdquo; The warriors urged
him, however, to summon the youth; and though
anxious to spare his youngest son, the king reluctantly
consented to have Siegmund<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> appear. The
lad stood straight and strong and fearless before the
lordly company, and asked what was the king&rsquo;s will.
Volsung pointed to the sword, and bade young Siegmund
draw it forth. To the astonishment of all
beholders, the lad stepped boldly up to the Branstock,
and, grasping the hilt of the sword, drew it out as
easily as if it had only been in the scabbard. The
guests were delighted at this evidence of Odin&rsquo;s
favour toward an untried stripling; and they all
praised Siegmund&rsquo;s good fortune&mdash;all but King
Siggeir, who hated the youth from that day. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
sought to buy the sword of Siegmund by offering
him thrice its weight in gold, but the youth replied:
&ldquo;You might have had the sword if it were Odin&rsquo;s
will that you should bear it. But now it shall stay
mine, though you offered me all the gold you have.&rdquo;
Then was King Siggeir filled with wrath at these
scornful words and vowed vengeance against Siegmund
and all the Volsungs.</p>

Spelled Sigmund in the Volsunga Saga. <a href="#FNanchor_41_41">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>When the wedding feast was over and the time
came for Signy to set sail with her husband to his
own land, King Siggeir spoke fair words to Volsung
and his ten sons, and begged them to visit him in
Gothland. Then said Signy to her father, &ldquo;I
pray thee, urge me not to go away with King Siggeir,
for by my foreknowledge I am certain that no good
will come of this marriage.&rdquo; But Volsung answered:
&ldquo;Speak not so, my daughter; and go with thy husband,
for it will bring great shame to us if we fail
to trust him without reason. Moreover, he will pay
us back most evilly if we break faith with him for no
cause.&rdquo; So Signy went with her husband, and they
sailed away from the land of the Volsungs.</p>

<p>Now at the appointed time when the king had
promised Siggeir to visit him in Gothland, Volsung
and his ten sons put forth in the ships with a goodly
following of men. After many days of pleasant
voyaging, they reached the stranger&rsquo;s country, and
came in toward the shore on the evening tide. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
before they made a landing, Signy the queen came
secretly to them, and begged them to return at once
to their own land, for Siggeir had sworn to kill them.
Her pleadings were in vain, however, for the grisly
old king of the Volsungs had never yet turned his
back to a foe, and he had no fear of Siggeir and his
hosts. So Signy went back to the palace, and the
old king with his followers waited for the dawn.
At a fitting time they left the boats, and sought
the way to King Siggeir&rsquo;s palace. They seemed a
gayly dressed company that had come as guests
to a marriage feast, but under their cloaks each
man carried a sword&mdash;being mindful of Signy&rsquo;s
warning.</p>

<p>No messenger came forth to welcome them, but
as they neared the palace King Siggeir fell upon them
with a great army, and neither bravery nor a good
sword could withstand the assault of such numbers.
The Volsungs fought hard, and with all the courage
of their race, and many a Goth lay dead at the old
king&rsquo;s feet and at the feet of his sons; but at last
Volsung himself was struck down by a treacherous
blow; and when his followers saw their leader dead,
they lost heart for the fight. Then all of the goodly
company that had come to Gothland with the king
were slain by Siggeir&rsquo;s men, and soon none were left
of all the Volsungs but the king&rsquo;s ten sons. These
were sorely wounded, yet alive, so they were bound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
with chains and carried before Siggeir that he might
determine by what torment they should die.</p>

<p>Now came Signy to the palace hall and begged
their lives of the king; but Siggeir laughed at her
prayers and bade his men slay the sons of Volsung
before their sister&rsquo;s eyes. But first he took from
Siegmund the coveted gift of Odin, declaring that
the youth should die by a stroke from his own sword.
Then Signy threw herself at the feet of her lord and
begged him to grant her brothers a few more days
of life. At the end of that time he might do with
them as he wished, and she would plead no more.
To prove that she had no thought of trying to release
them, she asked that they might be chained
to a certain fallen oak in the forest so that she could
visit them without incurring the king&rsquo;s displeasure.
As all of the Volsungs were wounded, and some of
them suffering greatly, this idea of prolonging their
torment pleased Siggeir&rsquo;s fancy; and he agreed to
let the brothers live for a few days chained to the
fallen oak; but meantime he shut Signy up in the
palace under a strict watch.</p>

<p>Now it happened that at midnight a she-wolf
came out of the heart of the forest; and, seizing upon
one of the Volsungs, devoured him, and then went
her way. When news of this dreadful disaster
reached Signy, she begged Siggeir to put her brothers
in prison; but the king only laughed again and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
the Volsungs in the forest. Each night, at midnight,
the she-wolf came out of the deep woods to eat one
of the brothers; and this was repeated until all
were devoured except Siegmund.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Then Signy
called to her a trusted servant, and putting a pot
of honey in his hand, she bade him go into the forest
and smear the face and hands of her brother with
the sweet liquid. The servant did as the queen instructed
him; so that night, when the she-wolf
came out of the forest, she smelt the sweet odour, and
instead of falling upon Siegmund to tear him to
pieces, she began to lick the honey from his face and
hands.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_42_42">[42]</a></span>
The she-wolf was supposed to be the mother of King Siggeir,
who had been turned into a wolf by a troll. <a href="#FNanchor_42_42">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Some of the liquid had dripped over Siegmund&rsquo;s
lips, and when the she-wolf thrust her greedy tongue
into his mouth, he caught it firmly between his
teeth and bit with all his strength. In her frantic
efforts to get loose from the torturing grip, the she-wolf
set her feet against the fallen tree and strained
so mightily that the chain which bound Siegmund
snapped in two pieces and the youth found himself
free. Then he seized the wolf by the throat, and
strangled her with his mere hands. Leaving the
beast&rsquo;s body and his own torn clothes by the oak
tree, he fled far into the forest.</p>

<p>King Siggeir believed that the last of the Volsungs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
had died in the same manner as his brothers; but
Signy felt in her heart that Siegmund had succeeded,
through her strategy, in escaping. Soon word was
brought to her by her faithful servant that Siegmund
was alive and in need of help; so each day she sent
the messenger to the forest with food for her brother
and the assurance that she would always watch over
his needs. Then Siegmund built himself an underground
hut in the woods, and lived as a wild man;
and thither came Signy by night, for King Siggeir
had granted the queen her liberty, believing that all
the Volsungs were dead. Between them they plotted
many things to avenge the murder of their kinsmen;
but as yet their plans seemed futile, for how could
one youth prevail against a king&rsquo;s army?</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a>The Vengeance of the Volsungs</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>O, many years went by, and two sons were born
to Signy and King Siggeir, both of them so
like their father that the queen saw no touch
of the Volsung spirit in either one, and no courage
on which she could rely to help her and Siegmund
in their work of vengeance. When the eldest was
ten years old, his mother sent him to the forest
that he might be trained by Siegmund if there were
aught in him worthy of the Volsung race. When
the lad came to the earth-dwelling, Siegmund saw
that he had none of the right mettle in him; but
he welcomed his sister&rsquo;s son and bade him make ready
the bread for the evening meal while he himself went
to seek firewood. On Siegmund&rsquo;s return the lad
was still standing with the bag of meal in his hand,
and there was no bread laid upon the coals. When
Siegmund questioned him, he answered, &ldquo;I dared
not set hand in the sack, for there was something
moving in the meal.&rdquo; So Siegmund sent the lad
back to his mother, for he knew that such a faint-hearted
youth could never help him to avenge his
murdered kinsmen.</p>

<p>Next year Signy sent her second son into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
forest; but he too was fearful of the meal, and said
on Siegmund&rsquo;s return, &ldquo;There is something alive
in the sack, so I dared not touch it.&rdquo; Then Siegmund
bade him return to his mother. Some years
later another son was born to Signy who in all ways
resembled the Volsungs, so tall and strong and fierce
he was, yet fair of face like Siegmund. When his
mother deemed him courageous enough and of hardihood
enough to stand an extreme test, she sewed
his shirt to his skin and then suddenly tore it off,
at which the child only laughed and said, &ldquo;How
little would a Volsung care for such a smart as that!&rdquo;
Then Signy knew that she might send the lad at
once to her brother; so she bade him go forthwith
to the earth house in the forest.</p>

<p>As soon as the lad, who was called Sinfiotli, came
to Siegmund&rsquo;s hut, he was told to knead the meal for
the baking, just as his brothers had been. Then
he was left alone, and when Siegmund returned from
gathering firewood, the bread was ready baked and
lying on the hearth. When asked if he had seen
anything move in the meal, the lad replied, &ldquo;Yes,
I felt there was something alive in the sack, but whatever
it was I have kneaded it all together with the
meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Siegmund laughed and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naught wilt thou eat of bread this night, for
thou hast kneaded up the most deadly of serpents.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
Though I may eat of any poison and live, there is
no venom which thou mayst take and remain alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Sinfiotli stayed with Siegmund in the earth-dwelling,
and was trained in all things that befitted
a warrior of the Volsungs. Together they roamed
the wild woods, hunting, fighting wild beasts and
plundering like outlaws&mdash;for in no other way could
they gain wealth. Sinfiotli soon forgot the days he
had spent in King Siggeir&rsquo;s palace and believed himself
in very truth a Volsung. Now it happened
that one day as they journeyed together through the
forest, they came upon a certain house in which lay
two men fast asleep. On the wrists and ankles of
the sleepers were heavy gold rings, and over their
heads hung two gray wolfskins. By this Siegmund
knew that they were werewolves and that this
must be the tenth night&mdash;at which time the spell
is removed and the enchanted may resume their
human shape.</p>

<p>Then Siegmund and Sinfiotli put on the wolfskins
while the men lay asleep; and having once done
this, they could in no way free themselves from the
enchantment until the appointed time. So they
rushed forth into the forest howling like wolves,
though each knew the meaning of the other&rsquo;s cries.
Having the nature of wild beasts, they went in search
of prey, but before taking their separate ways, they
agreed to come to each other&rsquo;s aid in this wise:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
that if more than seven men set upon either of the
twain, he should howl in wolfish fashion so loud
that his companion would hear him. So each went
his way, and in time Siegmund met with a band of
men who set upon him with spears; but he gave
forth a deep, far-sounding howl that brought his
fellow-wolf at once to aid him. Still in his wolfish
shape, Sinfiotli killed every one of the men who had
attacked Siegmund, and once more the friends parted.
Before he had gone far into the woods again, Sinfiotli
was suddenly surprised by eleven men with
stout hunting gear; but so fiercely did he fight
that in a short time the whole number were lying
dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>As Sinfiotli, weary from the battle, lay under an
oak tree, Siegmund came to him, and seeing all the
dead men, straightway asked, &ldquo;Why did you not
howl to me for help?&rdquo; And Sinfiotli answered,
&ldquo;I was loath to call on you for the killing of only
eleven men.&rdquo; Then a sudden wolfish anger came
over Siegmund, and he sprang upon Sinfiotli and
bit him in the throat. But as soon as he saw his
friend lying dead, he sorrowed greatly, and strove
to bear the body on his back to the earth-house.
The following day, as he lay at the door of the dwelling,
he saw two weasels fighting, and one of them bit
the other so that he died. Then the destroyer ran
into a thicket and returned with a leaf in his mouth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
which he laid on the wound of the dead weasel. To
Siegmund&rsquo;s surprise, it immediately sprang up well
and whole. Then a raven flew overhead with a leaf
of the same herb in his mouth, and this he dropped
just at the werewolf&rsquo;s feet. So Siegmund took the
leaf and laid it on Sinfiotli&rsquo;s wound, and he at once
came to life again. Then the two waited until the
day on which the enchantment was ended and they
might cast off their wolf shapes. On this day they
took the skins and burned them in the fire, that no
further harm might come to any man through
taking them.</p>

<p>Now by the time Sinfiotli had grown into manhood,
Siegmund felt that the hour had come for avenging
the death of the Volsungs, for he had tried the lad
fully, and found no fear in him. So on a certain
day they both left the earth-house and came late
in the evening to King Siggeir&rsquo;s palace. They had
no mind to walk at once into the king&rsquo;s presence,
so they hid themselves among some casks of ale
which were heaped up in the hall. While they lay
thus hidden, Signy was aware of their coming; and
as the king sat drinking deep she came out to them
and spoke softly with them. Then they plotted
together how they should slay King Siggeir, but the
queen dared not stay long with them lest some servant
should see her and tell it to the king.</p>

<p>Now that very night as the two children of Signy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
and the king were playing with a ball, one of the
rings came off, and, rolling out into the hall, glided
among the casks of ale. The children ran eagerly
after it, but when they spied the two grim and well-armed
men among the casks, they ran screaming to
their father and told him what they had seen. Then
the king grew fearful that some evil was awaiting
him; and as he sat not knowing what to do, Signy
led the children into the hall and said to her brother:
&ldquo;See, these two have betrayed you. Kill them,
therefore.&rdquo; But Siegmund answered, &ldquo;Never will
I slay thy children for telling where I lay hid.&rdquo;
Hardly had he spoken these words when Sinfiotli
drew his sword and killed both the children. Then
he took up the bodies and cast them at King Siggeir&rsquo;s
feet. This sight roused such wrath in the king that
he forgot his fear and ordered his men to seize hold
upon the strangers and bind them with fetters.</p>

<p>So Siegmund and Sinfiotli were set upon by a great
company of the king&rsquo;s men, but they fought so hard
and bravely that many bodies lay dead all around
them, and those who were wounded long remembered
this night&rsquo;s fighting. At last the strangers were
overpowered and bound with strong chains. Then
King Siggeir had them cast into a dungeon, while he
pondered all through the night as to what form of
death he could mete out to them. In the morning
he had a great pit dug, and in the midst of it he stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
on end a flat stone that reached from one side of the
pit to the other, but was so high that none could
climb over it. Then he set Siegmund in the pit on
one side of the flat stone, and Sinfiotli on the other,
and bade his men cover over the pit with turf, that
they might be buried alive. But while the servants
were laying on the turf, Signy came by with a bundle
of straw in her arms. This she threw into the pit
to Sinfiotli, and bade the servants say no word of
it to the king. Then the covering of turf was laid
on, and Signy went her way again.</p>

<p>As soon as he judged the night had come, Sinfiotli
unwrapped the bundle of straw to make himself
a bed; and as he groped through the bale in the
darkness he found a great lump of swine&rsquo;s flesh.
This he tore eagerly apart, for King Siggeir had given
the captives naught to eat since they were taken
prisoners. Then as he was rending the flesh in pieces,
his fingers suddenly closed upon some hard steel;
and when he drew it forth he found in his hand a
sword. It was Siegmund&rsquo;s sword, the gift of Odin,
which Signy had concealed in the straw unknown to
the king. Sinfiotli uttered a cry of joy, and grasping
the hilt firmly, he drove the point of the sword
into the great rock that divided him from Siegmund.
So fierce a blow did he deal that the sword cut
through the stone up to the hilt; and by means of
the great rent which it made, the two captives were
able to speak with each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
Then Siegmund grasped the blade of the sword,
and together he and Sinfiotli worked all night until
they had cut the great stone in half. When dawn
came, they had sawed so fiercely that the sword-blade
glowed in the darkness of the pit; and yet
the keenness of its edge had never dulled. Soon
Siegmund had cut a way through the turf and stones
that covered the pit; and he and Sinfiotli stood together
in front of King Siggeir&rsquo;s palace. There was
no sound within, for all were yet asleep; so Siegmund
and Sinfiotli crept softly into the hall carrying wood
in their arms; and this they placed in great piles
around the sleepers. Then they kindled a fire
which spread quickly through the dry leaves and
wood; and the smell of it awoke the sleeping men,
who looked about and wondered why so thick a smoke
was filling the hall. Soon the king was wakened by
the loud screams of the women, and when he saw the
smoke and flame he cried out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who has kindled this fire in which I burn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Siegmund answered him from without the
hall, &ldquo;It is I, Siegmund the Volsung, with Sinfiotli,
my sister&rsquo;s son; and now thou mayst know at last
that all of my race are not dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he closed and barred the palace doors that
none might escape, but first he begged Signy to
come quickly out of the hall lest she should perish
in the flames. And when she did not come, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
offered her rich gifts and a place of honour among
her own people; but Signy stood by the king&rsquo;s side
and answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have kept well in memory the slaying of the
Volsungs, and that it was King Siggeir who wrought
the shameful deed. I sent two of my sons into the
forest to learn how to avenge the wrong, and then
came unto thee Sinfiotli who is a Volsung and none
of King Siggeir&rsquo;s race. I also bade thee kill my
young children, since their words had betrayed thee.
For this and naught else have I wrought all these
years that Siggeir might get his bane at last. Now
vengeance has fallen upon him, but let the end come
also to me, for merrily will I die with King Siggeir,
though I was not merry to wed with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Signy perished in the fire with her husband,
and many died with them that the wrath of Siegmund
the Volsung might be satisfied. Then he
gathered together a great company of folk, and
filled many ships with the treasures of King Siggeir,
and with Sinfiotli he set sail for his own land. When
he reached the country of the Volsungs, he found that
a neighbouring king had usurped the throne, and was
reigning in the old king&rsquo;s stead. Siegmund drove
him from the country and himself took the throne
of his father, where he ruled thereafter for many
years. He and Sinfiotli waged war with other
kings, and their fame spread abroad throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
the land. None could equal them in strength and
valour, and of all the Volsungs King Siegmund bade
fair to be greatest in renown.</p>


<p class="break">As Regin spoke these last words, he turned to the
youth at his side and smiled when he saw the glow
of pride that shone in Siegfried&rsquo;s face as the master
spoke of the brave deeds of the Volsungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you the rest of the tale, and of how
the sword of Odin failed your father in his need?&rdquo;
he asked, knowing well the answer Siegfried would
make. Then the youth laid new coals on the fire;
and the master resumed the oft-told tale.</p>
</div>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>The Magic Sword</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>O Siegmund became a mighty king,&mdash;said
Regin,&mdash;and was known far and wide as the
giver of rich gifts. In time of war he fought
with Sinfiotli at his side; and when peace reigned
in the kingdom, the son of Signy sat in the seat of
honour by the king&rsquo;s throne. Now Sinfiotli loved
a fair woman who was also wooed by the brother of
Borghild, Siegmund&rsquo;s queen; and when they fought
this matter out between them, Sinfiotli killed the
queen&rsquo;s brother and took the maiden for his wife.
Then Borghild demanded that the slayer be driven
out of the kingdom because of this deed; but Siegmund
said that the man was killed in fair fight, and
therefore Sinfiotli should not pay the forfeit of banishment.
Hoping to soften the queen&rsquo;s anger, he
offered her gold and treasure as payment for her
brother&rsquo;s life, but she would have none of it. Seeing,
however, that she could not win her way with the
king, she pretended to forgive the deed; and asked
both Siegmund and Sinfiotli to the funeral feast
which she held in her brother&rsquo;s honour.</p>

<p>There were many guests gathered to the feast,
and Borghild, the queen, brought drink to each one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
When she came to Sinfiotli with the great horn in her
hand, she said, &ldquo;Drink now, fair stepson.&rdquo; But
when the youth looked into the horn he answered,
&ldquo;Nay, I will not, for the drink is charmed.&rdquo; Then
the queen laughed and handed the horn to Siegmund,
who drank the ale to the last drop, for no poison
nor charmed drink could work him any harm. A
second time did Borghild come to Sinfiotli with the
horn in her hand offering him drink, and again he
refused it, saying, &ldquo;Guile is in the drink.&rdquo; So
Siegmund took the horn and emptied it while the
queen taunted Sinfiotli with his fears and said,
&ldquo;Why must other men drink thine ale for thee?&rdquo;
A third time Borghild came with the horn, and she
goaded Sinfiotli with these words, &ldquo;Drink now, if
there is in thee the heart of a Volsung.&rdquo; So he
took the horn, but when he looked into it, he said,
&ldquo;Venom is therein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now by this time Siegmund was so dazed with
drinking that he had forgotten the queen&rsquo;s former
hatred for her brother&rsquo;s slayer, and he cried to
Sinfiotli, &ldquo;Drink and fear naught.&rdquo; So Sinfiotli
drank, and straightway fell down dead. When
Siegmund saw the youth lying dead at his feet, his
senses returned to him, and he sorrowed greatly over
the words he had spoken. Then he lifted the body of
Sinfiotli in his arms and bore it out of the palace hall
while the funeral guests sat silent, none daring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
intrude upon the king&rsquo;s sorrow. Now Siegmund
fared on through the woods till he came to the seashore,
and here he found a little boat with an old
man seated at the oars. The man wore a dark blue
cloak, and his hat was drawn down over his face;
but Siegmund saw none of this, for his thoughts were
with his dead companion. The old man asked if
they would be ferried to the other side of the bay,
and Siegmund came with his burden to the water&rsquo;s
edge. The little boat could not hold them all, so
Siegmund laid the body of Sinfiotli beside the ferryman.
But as soon as it was placed within, both the
boat and the old man vanished, and Siegmund found
himself alone. Yet his heart was full of gladness,
for he knew that it was Odin himself who had come
to take another Volsung to join the heroes in Valhalla.
Then Siegmund returned to his own hall, and
so hateful did the queen become in his eyes that he
could bear the sight of her no longer and drove her
forth from the palace. Not many months after this,
word was brought to him that Borghild was dead.</p>

<p>Now there lived in a neighbouring country a wealthy
king who had a daughter named Hiordis&mdash;the fairest
and wisest among women. When Siegmund
heard of the maiden&rsquo;s beauty, he desired to wed her,
though he himself was now well on in years. So he
chose the bravest warriors of his court, and with
his horses well-loaded with gifts, he set out for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
country where Hiordis lived. At her father&rsquo;s palace
he was royally welcomed, and his proposals were
received with favour; but there was another king
suing for the maiden&rsquo;s hand, so no promise could
be given to Siegmund. The father of Hiordis feared
that, whichever of the suitors was rejected, war and
trouble would arise, and therefore he knew not how
to answer them. So he went to his daughter and
said: &ldquo;You are a wise woman, and I will let this
matter rest in your hands. Choose a husband for
yourself, and I will abide by your choice though
my whole kingdom be plunged into warfare.&rdquo;
Then Hiordis answered, &ldquo;Though King Lyngi is
far younger than Siegmund, yet I will choose Siegmund
for my husband, for his fame as a warrior is
greater and we can rely upon his strength.&rdquo; So
Hiordis was wedded to Siegmund the Volsung, and a
great feast was held which lasted many days. King
Lyngi departed to his own country, but Siegmund
knew that he would hear of him again. After the
wedding festivities were over, the Volsungs returned
home; but they had been there only a few days
before word was sent to Siegmund that King Lyngi
had landed on his coast with a host of followers, and
demanded that the Volsungs should meet him in
battle.</p>

<p>Siegmund knew well that a great army had come
against him, yet he answered that he would fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
until no man was left in his kingdom; and accordingly
he gathered his army together and met the
forces of King Lyngi in an open field. The enemy
rushed from their boats in such numbers that it
seemed as if there was no end to them; and Siegmund
saw that his followers would be no match for
the great horde of fighting men that swept down from
the enemy&rsquo;s ships. Nevertheless the Volsungs
fought bravely when the horns blew that called the
men to battle, and Siegmund, at the head of his army,
cheered his followers on to the fight. He rushed
boldly through the ranks of the foe, and no helmet
or shield could withstand the stroke of his sword.
So fiercely did he fight that none could tell the tale
of those who fell before him, and his arms were red
with blood even to the shoulders.</p>

<p>Now when the battle had raged a long while, there
came a strange man suddenly into the midst of the
fight. He had a blue cloak upon his shoulders,
and a slouched hat was pulled down over his face
so that none might see he had only one eye. He
advanced upon Siegmund with a shield held aloft;
and the leader of the Volsungs&mdash;now sore spent with
battle&mdash;knew not who the stranger might be, so
he smote upon the upraised shield with all his
strength. Never yet had the magic sword failed him
in battle, but now it broke in half, and as its pieces
fell to the ground, the stranger in the blue cloak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
disappeared. Then Siegmund knew who it was that
had come against him, and he lost all heart for the
fight. His men fell fast all around him, and although
he fought on bravely, as became a Volsung,
he saw that the battle was already lost. Soon he
himself received a mortal wound, and when his men
saw their leader drop from the ranks, they had no
longer any hope of victory, and died fighting half-heartedly
beside the fallen Siegmund.</p>

<p>Now Hiordis had left the palace with her handmaid
when the battle first began, and she lay hidden
in the forest where none of King Lyngi&rsquo;s people might
find her. She had brought with her from the palace
as much gold and treasure as she and her bondwoman
could carry, that the conquering host might
not enjoy the whole of Siegmund&rsquo;s wealth. When
most of the Volsungs had fallen in battle, and King
Lyngi knew himself victor, he hurried to the palace
to take possession of Siegmund&rsquo;s riches and also
Siegmund&rsquo;s queen. But when he entered the palace,
he found everything in confusion. The treasure
chests had been emptied, and none of the frightened
servants could tell him what had happened nor
where the queen might be found. So King Lyngi
contented himself with what riches he found, and that
night his followers made merry in the halls of the
Volsung, drinking ale and boasting of the day&rsquo;s
victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
When Hiordis heard the noise of the midnight
revels, she crept out of her hiding-place and sought
for Siegmund among the countless dead. The
battle-field was a gruesome place, and she groped
blindly and fearfully among the wounded, hoping that
it might be here and not among the dead that she
would find her lord. At last she came upon Siegmund,
and tried to staunch the blood that still
flowed from his wounds; but he put her aside,
saying, &ldquo;I will not suffer myself to be healed, since
Odin wills that I should never draw sword again.&rdquo;
Then the queen wept softly and answered, &ldquo;If thou
diest, who will then avenge us?&rdquo; And Siegmund
said: &ldquo;Fear not that the last of the Volsungs has
stood to do mighty deeds, for a son will be born to
thee and me who shall be greater than all those who
have been before him. Cherish carefully the pieces of
Odin&rsquo;s sword which lie here beside me, for of these
shall a goodly sword be made, and our son shall bear
it, and with it he shall work many a great work so that
his name shall be honoured as long as the world
endures. Go now, for I grow weary with my
wounds and would fain follow my kinsmen. Soon I
shall be with all the Volsungs who have gone before
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Hiordis the queen kept silent, but she stayed
beside Siegmund until the dawning; and when she
knew he was dead, she took up the pieces of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
broken sword and carried them back with her into
the forest. Then she said to her handmaid: &ldquo;Let
us now change raiment, and do thou henceforth be
called by my name and say that thou art the king&rsquo;s
daughter. Look over there to the sea, where some
ships are now sailing toward our shores. Neither
to King Lyngi nor to the strangers that are approaching
would I be known as Siegmund&rsquo;s queen.&rdquo;
Then the women changed raiment, and stood
watching the ships as they neared the land.</p>

<p>The newcomers were not of King Lyngi&rsquo;s following,
but were Vikings who had put into that coast
on account of the high seas; and when they made a
landing they came up over the shore and looked
with wonder at the battle-field and the great number
of the dead. The leader of the Vikings was Alf,
the son of Hjalprek, king of Denmark, and as he
gazed across the battle-field he saw the two women
watching him, so he sent his men to bring them to
him. When Hiordis and her handmaid stood before
Alf, he asked them why they were standing thus
alone, and why so many men lay dead upon the field.
Then Hiordis, remembering the lowly position she
had assumed, kept silent, but the handmaid spoke
to him as befitted a king&rsquo;s daughter, and told him of
the fall of Siegmund and the death of the Volsungs
at the hand of King Lyngi and his hosts.</p>

<p>When Alf learned that the woman to whom he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
speaking was of the royal household, he asked if she
knew where the Volsungs&rsquo; treasure was hid; and the
bondmaid answered that she had the greater part of
it with her in the forest. So she led him to the spot
where the gold and silver lay; and such a wonder
of wealth was there that the men thought they had
never seen so many priceless things heaped together
in one place. All this treasure the Vikings carried
to their ships; and when they set sail it was with the
wealth of Siegmund on board as well as Queen
Hiordis and her handmaid. They spent many days
on the sea before they reached Denmark, and
during that time Alf spoke frequently with Hiordis
and her maiden, but often he sat by the bondwoman&rsquo;s
side, believing her to be the king&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>When the Vikings at last reached their own
country, they were met by the queen mother, who
listened gladly to the tale of their wanderings and
welcomed the strangers to the palace. Before they
had been home many days, she came to King Alf
and asked him why the fairer of the two women had
fewer rings and meaner attire than her companion.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I deem the one whom you have
held of least account to be the nobler born.&rdquo; And
Alf answered: &ldquo;I, too, have doubted that she is really
a bondmaid; for though she spoke but little when I
first greeted her, she bore herself proudly like a king&rsquo;s
daughter. But now let us make a trial of the two.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
So when the men were feasting that night, Alf left
his companions and came and sat down by the
women. Turning to the handmaiden, he said,
&ldquo;How do you know what is the hour for rising in
winter when there are no lights in the heavens?&rdquo;
And the bondwoman answered, &ldquo;In my youth I
was wont to get up at dawn to begin my tasks, and
now I waken as soon as the day breaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ill manners for a king&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; laughed
Alf, and, turning to Hiordis, he asked her the same
question.</p>

<p>The queen then unhesitatingly replied: &ldquo;My
father once gave me a little gold ring, and this
always grows cold on my finger as the day dawns.
Thus I know it is soon time to rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words King Alf sprang up, crying:
&ldquo;Gold rings are not given to bondmaids. Thou
art the king&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Hiordis the queen, seeing that she could
deceive Alf no longer, told him the truth concerning
her history, and when he knew she was the wife of
Siegmund he decreed that she should be held in great
honour. Not long after this the son of Hiordis and
Siegmund was born, and great rejoicing was made
throughout the kingdom, for when the child was
but a few days old, King Alf wedded Hiordis, whom he
had found the worthiest of women. The boy was
much beloved by his stepfather, and no one who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
looked upon him desired any other to succeed
King Alf upon the throne, for the child was beautiful
to see, brave and bold-looking, even as an infant.
His eyes had already the keenness of a falcon, and
so straight and strong he grew that the heart of King
Alf was filled with joy.</p>

<p>When Regin reached this part of his story, he
turned to Siegfried and laid his hand on the youth&rsquo;s
shoulder, saying: &ldquo;The gods have placed you
among a kindly people, and given you a foster-father
that has ever sought to train you in wisdom
and in strength. But you are not of this people,
and your place is not among them. Great deeds are
in store for you, and you are to be worthy of your
race. All that I could teach you, you have learned.
Go forth, therefore, and by your own hand win fame
that shall add to the glory of the Volsungs. Tomorrow
you shall fashion a sword for your use, and
it shall be mightier than any that has come from
our hands. But let us drop the tale now and sleep,
for it is almost daylight, and only a spark glimmers
in the forge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Siegfried made ready the fire, but
before he laid the steel in it he asked Regin what had
become of the pieces of Odin&rsquo;s famous sword. &ldquo;No
one knows where they are hidden,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> answered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
master, &ldquo;for on the death of your mother Hiordis,
the secret was lost, and no man can tell where
the place of their hiding may be.&rdquo; So Regin selected
the very finest steel for Siegfried&rsquo;s sword, and the
youth set to work eagerly, for Regin&rsquo;s story had
filled him with a burning desire to go out into distant
lands and do great deeds worthy of his name and
race. For seven days and nights he never left his
forge, but stood tempering and testing his steel, and
throwing aside every piece that did not seem perfect.
At last a blade was finished that promised to be
worthy of a Volsung. Regin praised it highly and
said he had never felt a finer edge. But Siegfried
only said, &ldquo;Let us prove it.&rdquo; So he took the sword
and smote with all his strength upon the anvil. The
blade shivered into a dozen pieces.</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing disheartened, Siegfried set to work again,
and spent many days and nights at his forge, often
forgetting to eat or sleep in his eagerness to finish
his task. When at last the steel had been finely
tempered and seemed of perfect workmanship, he
called to Regin and bade him try its strength.
&ldquo;Nay, let us not dull the edge,&rdquo; replied the master;
&ldquo;there is no need to put it to the test, for I can see
that it is true and strong.&rdquo; But Siegfried took the
sword and smote again upon the anvil; this time
the blade was blunted, though it did not break in
pieces. Then Regin besought him to try no longer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
but the youth, grim and determined, returned to the
forge and made ready his tools for another effort.</p>

<p>That night he paused many times in his work, and
often felt so discouraged that he was tempted to give
up the task; but each time he became ashamed of
his weakness, and bravely set to work again. Once
when he sat down by the fire to rest, he was conscious
of some one&rsquo;s being in the room, but thinking it
was Regin who had come to inspect his work, he did
not look up to see. At length, however, the silence
grew uncomfortable, and Siegfried turned around.
Close beside him was standing a tall man wrapped
in a dark blue mantle. His beard and hair were
very long and very white, and by the dim light of the
fire Siegfried noticed that he had only one eye.
His face was kindly, and his whole presence had an
air both gentle and reassuring, yet something about
him filled the youth with a strange awe. He waited
for the stranger to speak, but no word came, and
Siegfried began to tremble with nervous fear. At
this the old man smiled, and handed him the pieces of
a broken sword. Siegfried took them in wonder,
but before he could frame a question he found himself
suddenly alone; the stranger had disappeared.</p>

<p>The next morning Siegfried hastened to Regin and
told him of his strange visitor. Regin thought at
first that the lad had been dreaming, but when he
saw the pieces of broken sword, he cried out joyfully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fortune now be with you, Siegfried; for it was
no other than Odin who visited you, and these pieces
are of the famous sword which in former days the
ruler of the gods gave to your father. There is no
fear for your future now, since Odin has chosen to
watch over your welfare; and by his decree you will
stand or fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grasping the pieces of Odin&rsquo;s sword firmly in his
hand, Siegfried welded them together into a mighty
weapon, the strongest that had ever come from the
hand of man. And he called the sword Balmung.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Then he bade Regin test the mettle of the new blade,
and when the master looked upon it, it seemed as
though a fire burned along the edges of the sword.
Now Siegfried grasped the weapon in his two hands
and smote with all his strength upon the anvil, but
no pieces of steel fell shattered at his feet, for the
sword had cut the anvil in two as easily as if it had
been a feather. So Siegfried was satisfied.</p>

Fafnir&rsquo;s bane. <a href="#FNanchor_45_45">Back</a></p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day Regin said to Siegfried, &ldquo;You have
forged for yourself the famous sword Balmung
as your father Siegmund foretold.
Now it remains for you to fulfil the rest of the
prophecy and win fame that will add glory to the
name of the Volsungs. Of my celebrated wisdom
you have already learned all there is of worth, and
there are no ties to hold you to this people; but
before you leave the land which has nourished you,
there is one more task which I would fain lay upon
you&mdash;the slaying of the dragon which guards a
wonderful treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I start out upon adventures with nothing
but a sword, even though that sword be Odin&rsquo;s
gift?&rdquo; asked Siegfried. &ldquo;I have no horse, and I
should make a sorry appearance if I went on foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out into yonder meadow,&rdquo; said Regin, &ldquo;and
there you will find the best steeds that King Alf has
gathered either by purchase or as the spoil of battle.
Choose yourself one from among them; they are
all of noble race.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
Siegfried went over to the meadow where the stately
horses were grazing, and saw that each one of them
was truly fine enough to be the charger of a king&rsquo;s
son. Indeed, they all seemed to him so desirable
that there was none which he would prefer above
another. While he was hesitating, he heard a voice
at his side ask, &ldquo;Would you choose a steed, Sir
Siegfried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siegfried turned quickly around, for he had not
heard any one approaching, and his heart beat fast
when he saw beside him a tall form wrapped in a blue
mantle. He dared not look closer, and he trembled
now with both fear and joy, for the form and voice
were strangely familiar. Then falteringly he
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would indeed choose, but all the horses seem
to me to be of equal beauty and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head and said: &ldquo;There is
one horse here which far surpasses all the rest, for
he came from Odin&rsquo;s pastures on the sunny slopes
of Asgard. He it is you must choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly would I do so,&rdquo; replied Siegfried, &ldquo;but
I am too ignorant to know which he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive all the horses into the river,&rdquo; said the
old man, &ldquo;and I think you will then find the choice
easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Siegfried drove them out of the meadow, and
down a steep bank into the stream below. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
all plunged in boldly, but soon began to struggle
frantically against the current which was bearing
them rapidly down the river upon a bank of rocks
below. Some of the horses turned back when they
felt the force of the water; some fought helplessly
against it and were carried down toward the rocks;
but one swam to the other side and sprang up on the
green bank. Here he stopped a moment to graze,
then he plunged again into the stream, and, breasting
the current with apparent ease, he swam to the shore
and stood at Siegfried&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>The youth stroked the stately head and looked
into the large, beautiful eyes. Then turning to
the stranger he said, &ldquo;This is he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;this is he, and a
better steed did man never have. His name is
Greyfel,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and he is yours as a gift from Odin.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

The horse is called Grani in the Volsunga Saga. <a href="#FNanchor_46_46">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>So saying, the strange visitor disappeared, and
Siegfried returned to his forge full of joy and pride,
for he knew that no other than the Father of the
Gods himself had come to direct his choice.</p>

<p>When Regin heard of this second visit of Odin&rsquo;s
he said to Siegfried: &ldquo;You are truly blest and
favoured of the gods, and it may be that you are the
one chosen to perform the task of which I have
already spoken to you. I have cherished the hope
for many years that in you I might find one brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
enough to face the dragon, and restore the treasure to
its rightful owner.&rdquo; Then he told Siegfried of
Andvari&rsquo;s hoard, and of how it came to be guarded by
the dragon Fafnir. &ldquo;This monster,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;does not rest satisfied with the possession of his
treasure, but must needs live upon the flesh of men;
and he has thus become the terror of all the country
round. Many brave men have sought to slay him
for the sake of the gold, but they have only miserably
perished; for the dragon breathes out fire which will
consume ten men at a breath; and he spits forth
poison so deadly that one drop of it can kill. He is,
as I have told you, my brother, but nevertheless I
bid you slay him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; cried Siegfried, eagerly; &ldquo;for though
the monster be all that you have said, with Greyfel
and my sword Balmung I fear neither man nor
beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following day Siegfried bade farewell to
King Alf and started on his journey, taking Regin
with him, since the latter knew the road so well and
could guide him to the dragon&rsquo;s cave. They
travelled for many days and nights, and at last came
to a narrow river whose current was so fierce that
no boat, Regin said, was ever known to brave its
waters. But neither Siegfried nor Greyfel felt a
touch of fear, and the noble horse carried both riders
safely to the opposite bank. Here they found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
themselves at the foot of a tall mountain, which seemed
to rise straight up like a wall from the river&rsquo;s edge.
It was apparently of solid rock, for no tree or shrub
or blade of grass grew upon its steep side. There
were no sounds of birds in the air, no sign of any living
thing inhabiting this dreary place; nothing to see
but the rushing river over which the mountain cast
its gloomy shadow. It was enough to dishearten
the stoutest hero, but Siegfried refused to turn back,
though Regin, now trembling and fearful, besought
him to give up the adventure.</p>

<p>They went on some distance farther along the
river bank, to a place where the mountain appeared
less rocky and forbidding. There were patches of
earth to be seen here and there, and occasionally
a straggling tree sought to strike its roots into the
unfriendly soil. Pointing up through the trees,
Regin said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look close and you will see what seems to be
a path worn in the earth. It reaches from the
mountain top down to the water&rsquo;s edge, and it is
the trail of the dragon. Over this he will come
to-morrow at sunrise, but think not to encounter
him face to face, for you could not do it and live.
You must depend upon stratagem if you would hope
to slay him. Dig, therefore, a series of pits and cover
them with boughs, so that the dragon, as he rushes
down the mountain side, may fall into one of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
and not get out until you have slain him. As for
me, I will go some distance below, where the view
of Fafnir&rsquo;s cave is plainer, and I can warn you of
his approach.&rdquo; So saying, he went away, and
Siegfried remained alone, wondering at Regin&rsquo;s
cowardice, but content to face the danger with
only the help of Balmung.</p>

<p>It was now night, and the place became full of
unknown terrors. Even the stars and the moon
were hidden by thick clouds, and Siegfried could
hardly see to dig his pits. Every time he struck
the earth, the blow brought a deep echo from the
mountain, and now and then he heard the dismal
hoot of an owl. There was no other sound save
the noise of the swiftly running river, and his own
heavy breathing as he worked away at his task.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was aware that some one was standing
beside him, and when he turned to look, his
heart beat fast with joy, for even in the darkness
he fancied he saw the blueness of the stranger&rsquo;s
coat, and his long, white beard beneath the hood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing in this dismal country,
Sir Siegfried?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to slay Fafnir,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no fear, then?&rdquo; continued the
stranger, &ldquo;or no love for your life that you risk
it thus boldly? Many a brave man has met death
ere this in the perilous encounter you would try.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
You are young yet, and life is full of pleasures.
Give up this adventure, then, and return to your
father&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot,&rdquo; answered Siegfried. &ldquo;I am
young, it is true, but I have no fear of the dragon,
since Odin&rsquo;s sword is in my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well said,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;but if
you are to accomplish the slaying of Fafnir, do not
dig any pits here on the river&rsquo;s bank, for it will be
of no avail. But go up on the mountain side until
you have found a narrow path worn deep into the
earth. It is Fafnir&rsquo;s trail, and over it he is sure to
come. Dig there a deep pit, and hide in it yourself,
first covering the top with a few boughs. As
the dragon&rsquo;s huge body passes over this, you can
strike him from beneath with your sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the stranger finished speaking, Siegfried turned
to thank him, but he saw no one there; only Greyfel
was standing at his side. But his courage now rose
high, for he knew that it was Odin who had talked
with him. He hurried up the mountain side and
soon found the dragon&rsquo;s trail. Here he dug a deep
pit and crept into it himself, covering the top as
Odin had directed. For hours he lay still and waited,
and it seemed to him that the night would never end.
At last a faint streak of light appeared in the east,
and it soon grew bright enough for Siegfried to see
plainly about him. He raised one corner of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
roof of boughs and peeped cautiously out. Just
then there came a terrible roar which seemed to
shake the whole mountain. This was followed in
a moment by a loud rushing sound like some mighty
wind, and the air was full of heat and smoke as from
a furnace. Siegfried dropped quickly back into his
hiding-place, for he knew that the dragon had left
his cave.</p>

<p>Louder and louder grew the fearful sound, as the
monster rushed swiftly down the mountain side,
leaving smoke and fire in his trail. His claws struck
deep into the ground, and in his rapid descent he
sometimes tore up the roots of trees. His huge wings
flapping at his side made a frightful noise, while the
black scaly tail left behind it a track of deadly slime.
On he went until, all unknowing, he glided over the
loosely strewn boughs which covered the pit, and
Siegfried struck with his good sword Balmung.
It seemed to him that he had struck blindly. Yet
in a moment he knew that the blow was sure and
had pierced the monster&rsquo;s heart, for he heard it give
one roar of mortal pain. Then, as he drew out his
sword, the huge body quivered an instant and rolled
with a crash down the mountain side. But in
drawing out his sword from the dragon&rsquo;s heart, a
great gush of blood followed which bathed Siegfried
from head to foot in its crimson stream. He did
not heed this, however, but sprang out of the pit and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
hurried down to where the dragon, so lately a thing
of dread and horror, now lay apparently lifeless at
the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p class="caption">Siegfried fighting the Dragon</p>
</div>

<p>When Fafnir was aware that he had received his
death-wound, he began to lash out fiercely with his
head and tail, in hopes that he would thereby kill
the thing which had destroyed him. But Siegfried
stayed at a safe distance; and when he saw the
dragon cease its frantic struggles and lie quiet on the
ground, he came nearer and gazed at it in wonder and
half in fear&mdash;for Fafnir, though dying, was still
a terrible creature to look upon.</p>

<p>The dragon slowly raised its head as Siegfried
approached, and said, &ldquo;Who art thou, and who is
thy father and thy kin that thou wert so bold as to
come against me?&rdquo; At first Siegfried was loath
to tell his name<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>; but soon he felt ashamed of his
fears and answered boldly: &ldquo;Siegfried I am called,
and my father was Siegmund the Volsung.&rdquo; Then
said Fafnir, &ldquo;Who urged thee to this deed?&rdquo; and
Siegfried answered, &ldquo;A bold heart urged me; and
my strong hand and good sword aided me to do the
deed.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_47_47">[47]</a></span>
There is an old superstition that the curse of the dying is
sure to be fulfilled if he knows his enemy&rsquo;s name. <a href="#FNanchor_47_47">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Now Fafnir knew well who it was that had set
the youth upon this adventure, and he said: &ldquo;Of
what use is it to lie? Regin, my brother, hath sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
thee to work my death, for he is eager to gain the
treasure which I guarded these many years. Go,
therefore, and seek it out, but first I will give thee
this counsel; turn away thy steps from this ill-fated
gold, for a curse rests upon it, and it shall be the bane
of every one that possesses it.&rdquo; As he spoke these
words, Fafnir gave a fearful shudder that seemed to
make the trees around him tremble; and in a moment
Siegfried saw that the great dragon was dead.</p>

<p>Then Regin crept out of his hiding-place, and drew
near to the dead creature, peering closely into the
dull, glazed eyes to see if it were really a thing no
longer to be feared. A look of hatred came into his
face, but it disappeared quickly when he turned
to the youth at his side and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravely done, Siegfried! You have this day
wrought a great deed which shall be told and sung
as long as the world stands fast.&rdquo; Then he added
eagerly, &ldquo;Have you found the hoard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not look for it,&rdquo; answered Siegfried;
&ldquo;for after what you have told me of the curse
which rests upon it, I had no desire to touch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regin seemed now to be trembling with excitement,
and he exclaimed hurriedly: &ldquo;We must
seek it at once, yes, at once, before any one can
come to claim it and we thereby lose a wonderful
treasure. But let me go alone to find it, for you
would surely lose your way.&rdquo; Then as he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
Siegfried wiping his blood-stained sword on the earth, he
grasped the youth&rsquo;s arm fiercely and said: &ldquo;Do not
put the blade into its sheath until you have done one
thing further. While I am searching for the cave, do
you cut out Fafnir&rsquo;s heart and roast it, that I may
eat it upon my return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Regin&rsquo;s face had lost its
usual gentle and kindly look, and had become crafty
and sly and full of cruel cunning. He looked now
and then suspiciously at Siegfried, but the youth
turned his head away, for he could not bear to look
on at such a dreadful transformation. Meanwhile
Regin was muttering to himself: &ldquo;The gold! the
gold! and precious gems in great glittering heaps!
All of Andvari&rsquo;s hoard is mine now,&mdash;all mine.&rdquo;
And he hurried away, leaving Siegfried surprised
and sorrowing to find how soon the curse of that ill-fated
gold had fallen on its would-be possessor.</p>

<p>When Regin had gone, Siegfried set to work to
roast Fafnir&rsquo;s heart, and when the dreadful meal
was cooked, he laid it upon the grass, but in so
doing, some of the blood dropped upon his hand.
Wondering what taste there could be in the dragon&rsquo;s
heart to make Regin desire to eat it, Siegfried put
the finger, on which the blood had dropped, to his
lips. All at once he heard a hum of voices in the air.
It was only a flock of crows flying overhead and
chattering to themselves, but it sounded like human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
voices, and Siegfried could plainly tell what the crows
were saying. A moment later two ravens came
flying by, and he heard one of them say, &ldquo;There
sits Siegfried roasting Fafnir&rsquo;s heart that he may give
it to Regin, who will taste the blood, and so be able
to understand the language of birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other raven, &ldquo;and he is
waiting for Regin to return, not knowing that when
Regin has taken possession of the hoard, he will
come back and slay Siegfried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth listened to these words in sorrow and
surprise, for in spite of the look which he had seen
on Regin&rsquo;s face, he could not believe his master
guilty of such murderous thoughts.</p>

<p>Soon Regin returned, but what a change had
come over him. Siegfried saw that the raven&rsquo;s
words were indeed true, and that the curse of Andvari
had fallen upon the new possessor of the hoard.
If Regin&rsquo;s face had been mean and crafty before,
it was now ten times more dreadful, and his mouth
wore an evil smile which made Siegfried shudder.
It seemed, too, as if his body had shrunk, and its
motion was not unlike the gliding of a serpent.
He was talking to himself as he came along, and
appeared to be counting busily on his fingers. When
Siegfried spoke, he looked up and eyed him furtively,
then his face became suddenly black with
rage, and he sprang at the youth, crying: &ldquo;Fool and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
murderer, you shall have none of the gold. It is
mine, all mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the strength of a madman he dashed Siegfried
upon the ground, and seizing a large stick struck
him with all his force. But Siegfried sprang up
quickly and, drawing Balmung, prepared to defend
himself against Regin&rsquo;s attack. Enraged now to
the point of frenzy, Regin struck again and again,
and suddenly, in his blind fury, rushed upon Siegfried&rsquo;s
sword. Siegfried uttered a cry of horror and
closed his eyes, for he could not look upon the painful
sight. When he opened them again, Regin was
lying dead at his feet. Then he drew out his sword,
and, sitting down beside his slain friend, wept bitterly.
At length he arose, and mounting Greyfel rode
sorrowfully away.</p>

<p>The good horse bore him straight to Glistenheath&mdash;to
the cave where Fafnir had hidden the ill-fated
hoard. Here he found gold and gems in such heaps
that his eyes were dazzled, and he turned away
fearing to burden himself with the treasure and the
curse which rested upon it. But from the pile he
took Andvari&rsquo;s ring, which he placed upon his
finger, and a gold helmet. He also chose from the
treasures of the hoard a magic cape and a shield.
Then he remounted Greyfel, after placing upon him
as many sacks of gold as the horse could well carry.</p>

From this chapter on, the incidents follow the story in the
Nibelungenlied. <a href="#FNanchor_48_48">Back</a></p>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR many days Siegfried travelled on, saddened
and discouraged, and having no heart for
further adventures, since his first one had
ended so sadly. He felt that he cared but little what
became of him, and, letting the reins lie loose on Greyfel&rsquo;s
neck, he allowed the horse to carry him wherever
it would. At night he rested under the shade of the
forest trees, and by day he wandered aimlessly over
the country, too disheartened even to wish to return
to King Alf&rsquo;s court again. But although he did
not care to guide Greyfel, the horse was being led
by a hand far wiser than his own, for Odin had other
tasks in store for Siegfried, and it was he who now
directed the young hero&rsquo;s path.</p>

<p>One day at nightfall they came to the foot of a
mountain<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and Greyfel stopped, as if waiting for
his master to dismount. Siegfried, not wishing to
rest here, urged his horse forward; but, for the first
time, Greyfel refused to obey. His master, wondering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
at this stubbornness, but too tired and indifferent
to force him further, dismounted and prepared
to remain where he was for the night. Something
about the place, its loneliness and silence, recalled
the other mountain side where his first deed of
glory and his first great sorrow had come to him.
He could not sleep, so he wandered about among the
trees, now and then stopping to listen as some sound
broke the stillness of the night.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_49_49">[49]</a></span>
The mountain was called Hindfell. <a href="#FNanchor_49_49">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Once when he was looking toward the mountain
top, he fancied he caught the glimmer of a light
somewhere among the trees; and as he watched it
longer, he saw what appeared to be tongues of flame
leaping up and then disappearing. Alert now, and
eager to get nearer this strange sight, he mounted
Greyfel and directed him toward the fire. The
horse obeyed readily, seeming to know the way;
and when Siegfried drew nearer, he found that this
was no common fire, but a circle of flames enclosing
a large rock. There was no path up the mountain,
and Siegfried felt uncertain whether to proceed.
The horse, however, did not hesitate, but began the
ascent boldly, picking his way among the trees and
over the fallen trunks; sometimes stumbling and
sometimes bruising his legs, but never once faltering
or showing a desire to turn back.</p>

<p>Suddenly Siegfried felt upon his face a scorching
wind followed by thick smoke that blinded his eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
A quick turn of Greyfel&rsquo;s had brought them almost
upon a wall of leaping flames, which rose so high that
Siegfried could see nothing beyond them. The
intense heat burned his face, and he dared not open
his eyes to look about him. Greyfel snorted and
pawed the ground, then suddenly made a movement
forward as if to plunge into the flames. For an
instant Siegfried thought of the prophecy made by
his father Siegmund that he should be the greatest
of the Volsungs, and he hesitated to risk his life
thus lightly. Then he felt ashamed of the momentary
cowardice, and with but one quick throb of
fear at the peril he was rushing into, he bent forward
and spurred Greyfel into the fire.</p>

<p>It was all over in an instant. He felt the scorching
flames lick his face, and then he heard the horse&rsquo;s
feet strike upon solid rock. When he opened his
eyes to look about him, he realized that he had ridden
through the fire all unharmed, and he was full of
wonder at his safety. Greyfel, too, was unhurt; not
a single hair upon his mane was singed; and Siegfried
offered a silent prayer to Odin, who had guided them
through such peril.</p>

<p>He dismounted and looked about, and found that
he was standing upon the rock which he had seen from
below, and which he now discovered to be completely
encircled by the wall of fire. But stranger
even than this was the sight of a man lying full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
length upon the rock, and seemingly unconscious
of the fire which was raging all around him.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> His
shield was on the ground beside him, but his helmet
covered his face so that Siegfried could not tell
whether he was dead or sleeping. His figure was
youthful and his dress of richest texture, while the
armor which he bore seemed too fine to bear the
brunt of warfare.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_50_50">[50]</a></span>
In the Volsunga Saga, Brunhilde lies asleep in a shield-hung
castle surrounded by fire. <a href="#FNanchor_50_50">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>For a long time Siegfried stood beside the unconscious
figure, wondering whether he had best awake
the sleeper, or go away and leave him undisturbed.
At last his curiosity became too strong, and, lifting
the youth gently, he raised the helmet and gazed
with wonder and delight at the beautiful face
beneath. Then, as the sleeper did not awake, Siegfried
took off his helmet, hoping thus to rouse him;
but what was his surprise to see a shower of long
golden hair fall down over the shoulders of the
seeming youth. He started back so suddenly that
the maiden awoke, and looking up at Siegfried said
softly, &ldquo;So you have come at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young hero was too astonished to make any
reply, but remained kneeling beside her, waiting for
her to speak again. He wondered whether she was
really human, or only some spirit of the night.
Seeing his surprise, the maiden smiled, and, seating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
herself upon the rock, she pointed to a place beside
her and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Sir Siegfried, and I will tell you my
story, and how I came to be sleeping in this strange
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still wondering, especially at hearing himself thus
addressed, Siegfried obeyed, and the maiden began:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Brunhilde, and I am one of Odin&rsquo;s
Valkyries, or choosers of the slain. There are eight
of us who do this service, and we ride to battle on
swift-winged horses, wearing such armor as warriors
carry, except that it is invulnerable.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> We go into
the midst of the fight even when it is fiercest, and
when any of the heroes whom Odin has chosen are
slain, we raise him from the battle-field, lay him
before us on the horse, and ride with him to Asgard,
to the place called Valhalla. This is a beautiful
hall made of gold and marble, and it has five and
forty doors wide enough for eight hundred warriors
to march in abreast. Inside, its roof is made of
golden shields, and its walls are hung with spears
of polished steel that give a wonderful bright light
to all the hall. Every day the warriors drink of the
mead which is prepared for the gods themselves,
and they feast on the meat of a wonderful boar<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
which is daily slain and boiled in the great caldron,
and which always comes to life again just before the
heroes are ready to eat.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_51_51">[51]</a></span>

was the Aurora Borealis. <a href="#FNanchor_51_51">Back</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_52_52">[52]</a></span>
The boar was called Serimnir. <a href="#FNanchor_52_52">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes Odin sits at the board and shares the
feast with them, and when the Valkyries are not
doing service on the battle-field, they lay aside their
armor and clothe themselves in pure white robes,
to wait upon the heroes. When the feast is over,
the warriors call for their weapons, and spear in hand
they go out into the great courtyard, where they
fight desperate battles and deal terrible wounds,
performing deeds of valour such as they achieved
while on the earth. Since in Asgard there is no
dying, every combatant who receives some terrible
wound is healed at once by magic power. Thus
the heroes share the blessings and privileges of the
gods, and live forever, having won great fame and
glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there was a certain battle being waged in a
country far from here, in which the combatants were
an old warrior named Helm Gunnar, and a youth called
Agnar. Odin had commanded me to bear Helm
Gunnar to Valhalla, and leave the other to the mercy
of the conquerors. The youth of Agnar moved me,
however, to pity; so I left the old warrior upon the
battle-field, though he was already sore wounded.
Then I lifted Agnar from the ground, and, laying
him upon my horse, I carried him to Asgard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
&ldquo;In punishment for my disobedience and daring,
the All-father took from me forever my privilege of
being a Valkyrie, or shield-maiden. He also condemned
me to the life of a mortal, and then he
brought me to this rock, where he stung me with the
sleep-thorn, and made this my sleeping place. But
first he surrounded the rock with a wall of fire, and
he decreed that I should sleep here until a hero who
knew no fear should ride through the flames and
waken me. I am well versed in the lore of runes, and
I read there long ago that he who knows no fear is
Siegfried, the slayer of Fafnir. Therefore thou art
Siegfried and my deliverer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long time Brunhilde talked with him, and told
him many wonderful things, of the noble deeds of
heroes and of bloody battles fought in far-off lands.
Then, knowing that he was but a youth in spite of
his brave acts, she imparted to him something of
the wisdom she had gained as &ldquo;one of the greatest
among great women&rdquo;&mdash;for thus it was that men
spoke of her. She warned Siegfried of the dangers
he would encounter on his journey, and bade him
beware of the wiles of those who would call themselves
his friends. She charged him to abide always
by his oath, &ldquo;for great and grim is the reward for
the breaking of plighted troth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear and forbear, and so win for thyself long,
enduring praise of men.</p>

&ldquo;Give kind heed to dead men&mdash;sick-dead, sea-dead,
or sword-dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus spoke Brunhilde, and Siegfried listened,
and ever, as she stopped speaking, he begged to hear
still more. Then she read for him many things
written in the runes, and Siegfried listened, marvelling
at her wisdom.</p>

<p>The circle of fire had now burnt itself out, but
daylight had come, and Siegfried could plainly see
the perilous ascent he had made up the mountain.
Brunhilde took his hand and bade him farewell,
but, before she left him, Siegfried put upon her
finger the ring which he had taken from Andvari&rsquo;s
hoard. Then he watched her depart toward her
castle in Isenland, feeling very lonely, and wishing
he might follow her. But Greyfel&rsquo;s head was turned
a different way, and Siegfried knew that Odin had
other things for him to do, so he allowed the horse
to carry him away from Brunhilde&rsquo;s country, though
he would fain have gone thither. And Siegfried
longed for the maiden, and sorrowed at parting from
her; but Brunhilde, though she loved him well,
bade him go his way, since thus it was written in the
runes that not she, but another, should be the wife
of Siegfried.</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>Siegfried at Gunther&rsquo;s Court</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR several days Siegfried rode across the country
without meeting any one who could tell
him in what land he was, or whither the roads
would lead him. At times he longed to return to the
palace of King Alf, and again he hoped that Odin
was conducting him to new adventures which would
prove that his father Siegmund had not prophesied
great things of him in vain. He was growing very
weary of the continued stretch of forest and mountain
that never seemed to end, and he began to wonder
whether his dream of greatness was not, after all,
a thing of shadows&mdash;a mere will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, which
it would be foolish for him to follow. Yet Odin&rsquo;s
sword was in his hand, and the strange blue-cloaked
old man had already come to help him when he was
most in need of guidance. So, not knowing, himself,
in which direction to go, he let the reins lie loosely
on Greyfel&rsquo;s neck, and trusted to Odin to lead them.</p>

<p>Soon the forest ended and they came out into the
open country where Siegfried hoped he might meet
with some one who could tell him whither he was
faring. The landscape now changed to meadows and
ploughed fields, with here and there a castle perched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
high on the protecting hills. Siegfried kept as much
as he could on the well-travelled roads, since there he
would be most likely to meet with some other rider
who could direct his way; but all those whom he saw
seemed to be wanderers, like himself, and they could
tell him little of the country or the people. In
return, they would ask him whither he was going,
and what was the object of his journey, but to all
questions he offered no reply save that he was travelling
in search of adventures. But at heart he had
no desire for adventures, unless they led him among
people and into the life of the world. He had grown
weary of his solitude and his aimless wandering, and
longed for the companionship of men.</p>

<p>One day, late in the evening, he found himself on
the edge of a thick forest. He did not wish to enter
this, for it looked dark and impenetrable, and already
Greyfel was picking his way among brambles and
over uncertain ground; so he turned the horse&rsquo;s
head and prepared to go back to the road he had
lately left. But Greyfel knew better than his master
where to go, and persisted in moving forward into
what seemed to be the very heart of the forest. In
a moment, however, Siegfried found that they were
not stumbling helplessly about, for he heard the sharp,
clear sound of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs upon a hard road,
while the glimmer of many lights in the distance told
him he was not in a forest wilderness, but near some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
great city. Soon he met a man on horseback, and
inquired of him what country this was, and whither
the road would lead him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Burgundy, sir,&rdquo; answered the stranger,
&ldquo;and yonder is the city where King Gunther<a name="FNanchor_53a_53a" id="FNanchor_53a_53a"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53A]</a> himself
dwells. There you are sure of finding shelter and
entertainment for the night.&rdquo; Siegfried thanked
him, and spurred Greyfel toward the city.</p>

<p>In the palace of King Gunther, a great feast was
being held. There was wine in costly beakers, and
meat served upon plates of gold. At the place of
each guest was a silver goblet, and these were often
lifted high as the company drank to the health of
Gunther and all his noble race. While the men
feasted and drank, the women of the household stood
at the palace windows looking down the road to see
if some strolling minstrel might not be passing by
who could be summoned in to help them beguile
the weary hours that would follow the days of
feasting.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s mother, Queen Ute,<a name="FNanchor_53b_53b" id="FNanchor_53b_53b"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53B]</a> was busy with her
loom, for she cared no longer for the gayety of the
palace nor for any entertainment that some wandering
harper might provide. She was a wise woman,
learned in magic arts and the reading of dreams.</p>

<p>One day when her daughter, Kriemhild,
<a name="FNanchor_53c_53c" id="FNanchor_53c_53c"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53C]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
beautiful sister of King Gunther, came to her with
troubled face, she asked the maiden why she seemed
so sad, and Kriemhild answered: &ldquo;I dreamed last
night that a hawk with feathers of gold lighted on
my wrist; and naught was so dear to me as this hawk.
And I dreamed that I told both you and the king, my
brother, that I would cast aside all my rich raiment
and gems rather than lose the hawk that was
feathered with gold.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_53a_53a">[53A]</a>, <a href="#FNanchor_53b_53b">[53B]</a>, <a href="#FNanchor_53c_53c">[53C]</a></span>
In the Volsunga Saga, Gunther is called Gunnar, Ute is
called Grimhild, and Kriemhild is called Gudrun. <a href="#FNanchor_53a_53a">Back to 53A</a>, <a href="#FNanchor_53b_53b">Back to 53B</a>, <a href="#FNanchor_53c_53c">Back to 53C</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then said Queen Ute, the witch-wife: &ldquo;Trouble
not yourself over strange dreams. A hero is coming
to woo you, and he shall stay at your side even as
the hawk upon your wrist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now on this day when King Gunther was feasting,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and the women idly watched the long white line of
road where often a gallant horse and rider came galloping
toward the castle gates, the fair Kriemhild
suddenly exclaimed that some one was riding slowly
along the road. Her mother rose from the loom,
and standing by the open window she watched the
approaching figure with great interest. Then Queen
Ute said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_54_54">[54]</a></span>
In the Volsunga Saga, Siegfried goes to the court of Giuki,
king of the Niblungs, who has three sons: Gunnar, Hogni and
Guttorm. <a href="#FNanchor_54_54">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;That is no wandering harper, child, for see how
nobly he sits his horse. It is some knight with
tidings from a far country, or some king come hither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
to claim your brother&rsquo;s hospitality. But summon
Hagen and question him concerning the stranger.&rdquo;
So Kriemhild went out into the hall where Gunther
and his vassals sat at the great table drinking and
singing war-songs. Stepping softly to her uncle&rsquo;s
side, she whispered that a stranger was approaching
the castle, and begged him to look out and see if he
knew who the rider might be.</p>

<p>Hagen<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> was the oldest and most formidable warrior
in all the land of Burgundy. He was tall and
powerfully built, and gave the impression of great
strength, in spite of his gray hairs. His face was dark
and deeply furrowed, and the frown which he always
wore made him look grim and stern, as indeed he was.
He had never been known to care for any one or to
show the least regard for even his own sister Ute and
her household. Only toward Gunther, his liege lord,
did Hagen have perfect loyalty and a kind of doglike
fidelity, which kept him ever at the king&rsquo;s side
in the midst of the fiercest battles, and constant at
his service at the court when Gunther needed his
advice or support. He was famous, too, for his skill
in statecraft, and in all matters of government was
considered wiser than any of the king&rsquo;s other counsellors.
He also added to this a wonderful knowledge
of men and things, and could recount the deeds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
famous heroes, all of whom he knew by name and
lineage.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_55_55">[55]</a></span>
Called Hogni, in the Volsunga Saga. He is the king&rsquo;s
brother&mdash;not his uncle, as in the Nibelungenlied. <a href="#FNanchor_55_55">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>When Hagen came to the window at Kriemhild&rsquo;s
request, he looked out for some moments in silence,
then he said: &ldquo;The youth whom you see approaching
is Siegfried, the slayer of Fafnir, and owner of a
famous hoard.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It would be well for the king if he
made this man his guest.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_56_56" id="Footnote_56_56"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_56_56">[56]</a></span>
In the Nibelungenlied, Siegfried took the treasure from two
princes, the sons of King Niblung. <a href="#FNanchor_56_56">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The queen hastened to send word to the porters
to open the castle gates and invite the stranger to
enter. Then she told the king that a noble prince
had come to be his guest.</p>

<p>So Gunther and Hagen, followed by a retinue of
knights, went to the great door of the palace and
welcomed Siegfried to Burgundy. The young hero
was surprised and pleased at such a cordial reception,
and when the king urged him to remain with them
some days, he gladly consented, for the castle with
its gracious household seemed a pleasant resting-place
after his days of wandering.</p>

<p>Many feasts were now given, and games were held
in Siegfried&rsquo;s honour, to which all the princes of Burgundy
were invited. The king would not allow him
to speak of leaving them, and Siegfried was readily
persuaded to stay yet longer, for the days passed
quickly and happily at Gunther&rsquo;s court. The king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
became his friend and constant companion, and the
beautiful Kriemhild often talked with him. Only
Hagen kept aloof, grim, silent and distrustful.</p>

<p>Just before Siegfried&rsquo;s arrival, Gunther had become
involved in a war with one of the neighbouring
princes, and as the number of his forces was much
inferior to that of the enemy, he feared defeat and
the possible loss of his crown. Since the very beginning,
fortune had been against him, and he grew
daily more fearful lest it should end in the overthrow
of his kingdom. Not wishing to risk another disastrous
battle, Hagen went to the king one day and
said: &ldquo;Let us not allow Siegfried to sit idly here in
the palace while we go to the battle-field. Bid him
help us before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, he is our guest,&rdquo; replied the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of that,&rdquo; cried Hagen, impatiently; &ldquo;he
has been here many days, and, as he holds himself
your friend, your cause should be his also. We need
help, and he alone is powerful enough to turn the
tide of battle in our favour. He has a magic cloak
called the Tarnkappe, which is of little use to him
as he sits here in the palace. He also has the mighty
Balmung, which was forged from the pieces of Odin&rsquo;s
famous sword, and which should not be allowed to
hang idle at his side. With Siegfried as an ally, no
enemy can stand against us. Entreat him, therefore,
before another day has passed.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
So Gunther sought out Siegfried, and, after telling
him of the plight of the Burgundians, begged him to
aid them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right willingly will I join you, my friend,&rdquo; said
Siegfried. &ldquo;There is nothing I would gladlier do
than help your cause. I would have been at your
side long since had not your gentle sister besought
me not to trouble myself over the affairs of your
kingdom, and assured me that your forces were more
than a match for the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Siegfried fought beside the king, and
then victory followed victory for the disabled ranks
of the Burgundians. The soldiers rallied under his
leadership, and went boldly into the fight, while the
enemy fell in great numbers beneath the terrible
strokes of Balmung. A sudden panic came upon the
hitherto victorious host, and they fled in terror before
Gunther&rsquo;s pursuing army. This battle was followed
by many others in which the Burgundians completely
routed the enemy&rsquo;s forces, and their leader was
obliged to sue for peace. So the war was ended, and
the heroes returned to their homes to exchange the
sword and shield for the milder pleasures of the
palace.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Hagen came again to King Gunther
and said: &ldquo;This great victory has proved how strong
an ally we have in Siegfried. It were well, therefore,
to keep him with us, lest trouble arise again and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
need his help. Let us bind him to our house by some
close tie, and as no bond is closer than marriage,
you must wed him to your sister Kriemhild, who already
looks upon him with favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that cannot be, much as I desire it,&rdquo; answered
Gunther, &ldquo;for Siegfried will not wed with my
sister, since his heart yearns for Brunhilde, and he
is even now planning to seek her in Isenland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this is true,&rdquo; answered the wily Hagen; &ldquo;and
while Siegfried longs for the shield-maiden, nothing
can be done; but summon your mother hither,
and bade her mix for him a draught of forgetfulness.
She is skilled in magic potions, and will give us such
help as we need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunther sent at once for Queen Ute and told her
of Hagen&rsquo;s plan, to which she willingly offered her
assistance; and that night when Siegfried returned
from a journey to a neighbouring city, she offered
him a cup into which she had put a magic drink
which made him forget Brunhilde and his ride
through the wall of fire. Then he turned more
kindly eyes upon the beautiful Kriemhild, and before
many days went by, he sought her hand in marriage
of Gunther and the queen. Even to the unfriendly
Hagen did he urge the acceptance of his
suit, and the grim old warrior replied, &ldquo;Gladly do we
yield to you this flower of Burgundy; but to no other
man would we have given her for all his prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
When it was known throughout the kingdom that
such a powerful prince as Siegfried was going to
ally himself with the house of Burgundy, there was
great rejoicing among the people, for Siegfried had
already made himself both feared and loved. The
wedding festivities lasted several weeks, and many
costly gifts were distributed by King Gunther among
his vassals.</p>

<p>Yet in the midst of all the rejoicing, a strange feeling
of uneasiness oppressed Siegfried, and he felt
himself struggling with some memory that would not
take shape in his mind. As his troubled looks seemed
to worry the gentle Kriemhild, he tried to banish
the haunting memory, and join in the merriment
that attended his marriage.</p>

<p>Soon Hagen, who knew that Siegfried was the possessor
of Andvari&rsquo;s hoard, caused it to be whispered
about that the young hero had brought no gift to
his bride, and that he lived, with empty hands, upon
King Gunther&rsquo;s bounty. When this rumour reached
Siegfried, he grew pale with angry pride; then, in
the presence of all the court, he made a formal gift
to Kriemhild of all his treasure, both the chests of
gold which he had carried on his horse, and the great
hoard which still lay in Fafnir&rsquo;s cave. In his resentment
and wounded pride he forgot the curse which
still rested upon it, and because of the drink which
Queen Ute had given him, he forgot the ring that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
had placed on Brunhilde&rsquo;s finger. Gunther and his
people were delighted with the magnificence of the
bridal gift, and even Hagen felt satisfied, for he
knew nothing of the curse, and hoped sometime to
induce Siegfried to have the hoard brought to Burgundy.</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a>The Wooing of Brunhilde</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>IEGFRIED&rsquo;S days passed happily at Gunther&rsquo;s
court, and now that he had become the husband
of the beautiful Kriemhild he desired
nothing better than to spend his life beside her in the
pleasant land of Burgundy. Ever since the day of
his marriage all of his former life seemed to be
shrouded in mist. He but dimly remembered the
forging of Balmung and his fight with the dragon
Fafnir, while the meeting with Brunhilde had, owing
to the magic potion, passed wholly from his memory.
He was very happy with the lovely and gentle
Kriemhild, who had wedded him believing that she
alone had won the young hero&rsquo;s heart, for her mother
had spoken no word to her of the Valkyrie whom
Siegfried loved, or of the draught which had been
given to make him forget her. As for Siegfried, he
was proud of being chosen above all the other suitors
who came to win the hand of Gunther&rsquo;s sister; and
he was sure that there lived upon the earth no maiden
fairer than the peerless Kriemhild.</p>

<p>One day there came to the palace an old harper.
His hair was white and his figure bent with age, but
he could still play wonderful music, and sing bravely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
of the deeds of heroes. Many days and nights he
sang in the great hall of the castle, and the listeners
never wearied of his music. Sometimes he laid
aside his harp and told strange tales of his wanderings;
and one night as he sat before Siegfried and
King Gunther at the feast, he spoke to them of a
certain country called Isenland, where dwelt a beautiful
maiden whom many kings and princes had
sought to wed. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the old man,
&ldquo;she has never yet been won, for she is a warrior
queen, and to those who seek her hand she proposes
a trial of strength with the condition that he who
loses in the contest must also lose his life. This
has daunted many a suitor, for the fame of the
maiden&rsquo;s strength has spread far and wide, yet there
have been some brave men who have dared to try,
and, failing, have forfeited their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why is she willing to marry, if she has more
than a man&rsquo;s strength, and can go to battle like any
warrior?&rdquo; asked Gunther.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not wish to do so,&rdquo; replied the harper;
&ldquo;but it is written in the runes that she must wed.
She is determined, however, to yield only to the hero
whose strength can surpass her own, and therefore
she demands that all suitors shall meet her in this
contest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo; asked the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Brunhilde,&rdquo; answered the old man, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
at this Gunther looked fearfully at Siegfried, wondering
if the name would bring back to him the
memory of his ride through the fire and his meeting
with the Valkyrie. But on Siegfried&rsquo;s face was a
look of entire unconcern, and he smiled as the blood
rushed into Gunther&rsquo;s cheeks, and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look now at the king&rsquo;s face, Sir Harper, and
see how quickly you have found another victim for
the warrior maiden. Methinks he is already eager
to behold her beauty and win her for his queen.
How is it, friend Gunther?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even as you have said,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;for
I would fain risk my life to gain this wonderful
maiden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, Gunther was so much in earnest in his
wish, and so determined to journey to Isenland, that
no advice from Hagen could turn him from his purpose,
neither were the gentle pleadings of Kriemhild
of any avail. He would have Brunhilde and no one
else for his queen.</p>

<p>When it was settled that he should go to Isenland,
Hagen came secretly to him and said: &ldquo;If you
are really bent upon going on this foolhardy journey,
and desire to risk your life for a woman who is doubtless
not worth the winning, take Siegfried with you.
He has the sword Balmung with which to fight your
battles, should you be beset with foes, and he has also
the magic Tarnkappe which renders him invisible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
This will help to bring you out of many unknown
difficulties. Urge him, therefore, to go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunther did as Hagen advised, but it needed
no urging to obtain Siegfried&rsquo;s ready consent to
accompany the king. He had grown somewhat
weary of the quiet, uneventful life at the court,
and longed for new adventures. The beautiful
Kriemhild wept and besought him not to go into a
far country, and on an undertaking fraught with
many dangers; but Siegfried only laughed at her
fears, and bade her get his clothing and armour ready
for the journey. To Gunther he said, &ldquo;There
is one thing you must do if you wish me to accompany
you, and that is to give me your promise not
to take any train of warriors with us, but to go
alone with only Hagen and your brother Dankwart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed a very singular demand, and Hagen
declared that the king should not listen to it; but
Gunther trusted Siegfried&rsquo;s discretion, and was
willing to be guided by his wishes, so he consented,
and no one prepared for the voyage to Isenland save
those whom Siegfried had chosen.</p>

<p>Kriemhild and her maidens spent many days
making rich garments and embroidering costly
robes, for she wished to have the warriors of Burgundy
apparelled as became their rank. Queen
Ute, also, brought out from her large chests many
fine fabrics and rare jewels, and with threads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
purest gold worked beautiful pieces of raiment,
that Gunther and his friends might make a suitable
appearance at the court of Brunhilde. But it
troubled her that no retinue of lords was to be allowed
to attend the king, as was customary when
royalty travelled abroad; and she felt some resentment
toward Siegfried for compelling the ruler of
all Burgundy to go to a foreign court with no followers
save three of his own kinsmen.</p>

<p>While Queen Ute and Kriemhild were busy at
their needlework, the ship on which the king was to
sail was made ready, and fitted up with all things
which might be needed on the voyage. The most
skilful rowers in the kingdom were placed at the oars,
and at last the ship was launched and the sails set.
There was much weeping at the departure of Gunther
and his friends, and the watchers on the shore
felt that they would never return from the journey.
But the heroes themselves were eager for the voyage,
and full of hope that their adventure would be successful,&mdash;all
but Hagen, who stood on the deck,
grim-visaged and scornful, for he had no faith in this
foolish undertaking, though he would have followed
his king to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>The voyage to Isenland was long, but no peril
of wind or weather followed the ship, and no dangers
of rocks and shoals marred the pleasure of the journey,
or hindered the good ship&rsquo;s speed. When at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
last they came in sight of a rocky coast, and saw on
the top of the cliffs a tall, fortressed castle with frowning
towers, Hagen told them that they had now
reached Isenland, and that before them was the
palace of Brunhilde. It looked very forbidding,
and Gunther began to doubt if, after all, this venture
had been a wise one; but Siegfried was light-hearted
as ever, and the gloomy towers brought him no anxiety
or fears. As they were about to land he said
to the king:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing further you must do if we wish to
win in this undertaking. Tell every one at Brunhilde&rsquo;s
palace that I am your vassal, and have come
hither at your command to attend you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunther looked surprised at this demand, but
he consented, and on the way to the castle Siegfried
followed behind the king, as became a vassal in
attendance on his lord.</p>

<p>From her chamber window the queen was looking
down upon the knights as they rode toward the
castle,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and calling her maidens to her she said:
&ldquo;Who are these strangers that have come to our
gates? They seem of noble bearing, yet they have
no attendants, so cannot be of royal blood. Let
some one go to meet them, and inquire of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
names, and why they have voyaged to Isenland,
for in the harbour yonder I see a white-sailed ship.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_57_57">[57]</a></span>
In the Volsunga Saga, the castle is called Hlymdale, and
Gunnar has to ride through the flames, with Sigurd&rsquo;s help, to
win Brunhilde. <a href="#FNanchor_57_57">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>One of the maidens went away at the queen&rsquo;s
bidding, and soon returned breathless with excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Gunther, king of Burgundy, my lady,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;and with him are his brother and uncle,
and a noble youth named Siegfried. I hear that
they have come to match strength with you in the
games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Brunhilde learned that it was Siegfried
who was at her castle gates, she trembled with delight
and surprise; for <em>she</em> had been given no draught
of forgetfulness, and she well remembered the brave
youth who had ridden through the fire and wakened
her from sleep. If he had come to win her, she hoped
that his strength was equal to his valour, and that it
would surpass her own. For the first time since
Odin took away her shield, and with it the glory of
being a Valkyrie, she felt glad that she was a mortal
maiden.</p>

<p>Word was sent to the lords within the castle to
let down the drawbridge, and welcome the strangers
to Isenland. The queen also bade them give the
guests the best which the palace afforded, and do
everything which would make for their pleasure
and comfort. When she herself was arrayed in her
costliest robes, she descended to the great hall of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
the castle. There, seated upon a marble throne,
and surrounded by her chosen warriors, she received
the stranger knights in royal state.</p>

<p>To Gunther, who approached first, she offered her
hand and bade him welcome. This courtesy she
also extended to Dankwart and Hagen; but when
Siegfried stood before her she rose, and, taking both
his hands in hers, she said softly: &ldquo;So you have
come again to seek me, Sir Siegfried, but this time
it is not through a circle of fire. It is long since we
last met, but I have not forgotten you, nor have I
lost the ring you placed upon my finger. There is
no one whom Brunhilde would gladlier see within
her halls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siegfried at first seemed bewildered at her words;
then a troubled look passed over his face, and he
rubbed his eyes as if awakening from sleep. He
gazed long into the queen&rsquo;s face, murmuring, &ldquo;Brunhilde&mdash;the
Valkyrie&mdash;the wall of fire.&rdquo; Then
all at once a mist was lifted from his eyes; he remembered
his ride through the flames, the sleeping
maiden, and all of the past which had been so long
forgotten.</p>

<p>Brunhilde saw the change in his face, but she
mistook its meaning. She thought that he had
carelessly forgotten her, and was now trying to
recall some memory of her. So her soft manner
turned to hardness, for her pride was hurt, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
maiden shame forbade her to show favours to one
who could so easily forget her. During all his
stay at the castle she kept aloof from Siegfried, and
treated him with more coldness than she showed even
to the grim-visaged Hagen.</p>

<p>As for Siegfried, he knew that something had
happened which had blotted out the memory of
Brunhilde during all the years he had been in Burgundy;
and he knew also that if he could now
choose his bride, it would be the haughty queen who
treated him so scornfully. But he was here as
Gunther&rsquo;s friend and vassal, and to help Gunther
win this maiden for his wife; so he laid aside his own
regrets, and determined to do all in his power to
further the king&rsquo;s suit.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the Burgundians, a day
was set for the contest between King Gunther and
the warrior queen. At the appointed time they
assembled in the courtyard of the palace, and Hagen
had many misgivings when he saw five hundred
armed knights standing about, whose faces betokened
no good-will to the strangers. However, it was now
too late to retreat, and he muttered to the king,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have truly come hither on a fool&rsquo;s errand;
for whether you win or lose in this contest, we will
never be allowed to leave this place alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Gunther only laughed and said: &ldquo;Your
gray hairs make you full of fears, O Hagen; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
your age makes you blind to the beauty of this
wonderful maiden, for whom a man might well
risk his life. But fear not for me, as something tells
me that I shall win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he went away, leaving Hagen to mutter
curses on the whole mad adventure.</p>

<p>When Brunhilde appeared in the courtyard clad
in her coat of mail, the four Burgundian warriors
approached her, and Siegfried said, &ldquo;My liege lord
has come from far to match strength with you, O
Brunhilde, and should he win in the contest, there is
none who will give you allegiance as his queen more
gladly than the humble and loyal vassal Siegfried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Brunhilde answered coldly, &ldquo;Does your
lord know the conditions of the contest and the forfeit
we demand, should he lose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; replied Siegfried; &ldquo;but nothing outweighs
the chance of possessing Brunhilde for his
queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we accept the challenge,&rdquo; said the maiden,
and, turning to one of her attendants she added,
&ldquo;Bring hither my armour, and let the games begin.&rdquo;
The servants then brought her a golden helmet, a
corselet of finely wrought silver, and a shield broad
and heavy enough for the most powerful warrior.
After arming herself with these, her spear was carried
in on the shoulders of three strong men. It
was very long, and of such tremendous weight that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
no arm but Brunhilde&rsquo;s had ever been known to
lift it.</p>

<p>While these preparations were going on, the Burgundian
heroes were watching with amazement,
half mingled with fear, and Hagen muttered aloud,
&ldquo;Shall we stand idly by and see our king slain by a
woman&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; But Siegfried whispered in Gunther&rsquo;s
ear, &ldquo;Take courage and we shall win, only
show no sign of fear.&rdquo; Then he slipped out of the
crowd and hurried down to the seashore where the
ship lay at anchor. Here he hastily donned his
Tarnkappe, and then went back, unseen, to the
courtyard, where Gunther had already taken up his
shield, and Brunhilde was poising her spear in the
air ready to throw.</p>

<p>He took his stand close to the king&rsquo;s side and
whispered, &ldquo;Fear not, only do as I bid you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he could see no one, Gunther knew that
it was Siegfried who was beside him, so he took
courage and grasped his shield more firmly.</p>

<p>The signal was given, and Brunhilde hurled her
spear at Gunther&rsquo;s shield. The blow was a terrible
one, and both Siegfried and the king staggered
beneath it. Borne down by the weight of the spear,
and by the force with which it was thrown, Gunther
would have been crushed under his shield had not
Siegfried broken the force of the blow by placing
himself in front of the king, while he held before him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
the magic shield which he had taken from Andvari&rsquo;s
hoard. Then he quickly raised the king, and before
the astonished spectators realized what had happened,
he picked up the huge spear and sent it, apparently
from Gunther&rsquo;s hand, back to Brunhilde. It sped
with terrible swiftness, and struck her shield with a
tremendous crash, carrying the warrior maiden to
the ground. In a moment she recovered herself and
rose, flushing with shame and anger. Going to
where the king stood, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a noble blow, King Gunther, and I
count myself fairly beaten at this first game, but you
must also win in casting the stone and in leaping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, ten men came forward, carrying an
immense stone upon their shoulders. This the
maiden raised easily in her white arms, and swinging
it once or twice above her head, she threw it to the
farther end of the castle yard, some hundred yards
away, and then leaped after it, landing just beside
it.</p>

<p>The followers of Brunhilde shouted with delight,
and every face showed pride in their wonderful
queen; but Dankwart trembled with fear, and old
Hagen bit his lip and cursed the day that had brought
them to Isenland. At Gunther&rsquo;s side, however, was
Siegfried, still whispering courage to the king, who
could not see his friend, though he knew who it was
that was winning the contest for him. Together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
they walked to where the great stone was lying, and
Siegfried raised it from the ground, while it seemed
to the spectators that it was lifted by the king&rsquo;s
hand. Then he swung it above his head, and hurled
it across the courtyard, where it landed far beyond
the spot from which Brunhilde had first thrown it.
Immediately he seized Gunther in his arms and sprang
after the stone, reaching the very place where it lay
half buried in the earth.</p>

<p>The warrior maiden could do naught but own
herself beaten in all the games, and though her face
showed disappointment and chagrin, she offered her
hand to Gunther, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We acknowledge ourselves defeated, my lord,
and from henceforth Brunhilde is no longer her
own master, but the wife and vassal of the king of
Burgundy,&rdquo; and, turning to her knights and attendants,
she bade them acknowledge Gunther as their
rightful lord.</p>

<p>That night there was great feasting in the palace,
though the hearts of the people of Isenland were
heavy at the thought of losing their queen. She
herself strove to appear happy and proud at becoming
the wife of a hero whose strength surpassed her
own; yet while she seemed to honour her liege lord,
her heart longed for Siegfried, and she rued the day
that had brought the Burgundians to Isenland.</p>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a>How Brunhilde Came to Burgundy</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>O Brunhilde and the Lord of Burgundy were
wedded, and, after many days spent in feasting
and merriment, Gunther told his queen
that they must prepare for the return voyage. It
was some time since he and his friends had set out
on their journey to Isenland, and he feared that if
he stayed much longer at Brunhilde&rsquo;s palace, his own
people would give them up for dead. Then he
went secretly to Siegfried, and with a shamed,
flushed face he said: &ldquo;My friend and brother, I
have come to ask your help in a strange matter. I
cannot return to Burgundy with a wife who is my
master, even as Brunhilde is now, for I shall become
the laughing-stock of all my people. The queen of
Isenland does not love me, and she treats me each
day with more contempt. She does not scruple to
insult me by making me the victim of her great
strength, which I am powerless to meet. Her might&mdash;which
no other woman has ever equalled&mdash;depends
on a wonderful girdle which she wears; and
when I tried to wrest this from her, she tied me hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
and foot and hung me on a nail in the chamber wall.
Only by my promising never to trouble her again
was I able to get release.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siegfried felt sorry indeed for Gunther&rsquo;s plight,
and he offered to try and subdue the warrior queen
to her husband&rsquo;s will. So that night he assumed the
form of Gunther, and wrestled with Brunhilde until
he had taken from her the wonderful girdle in which
lay all her unwomanly strength. He also took from
her finger the serpent ring of Andvari which he himself
had given her when they had talked together on
the mountain. Brunhilde, being now quite ready to
obey her lord, believing that he was truly her master
by virtue of his superior strength, prepared for her
departure from Isenland, and took with her as many
of her own followers as Gunther would allow. He
besought her not to overburden the good ship which
had brought them thither with chests of raiment and
household goods, since Queen Ute could amply provide
all that Brunhilde might desire.</p>

<p>As to the wealth she had at her command, he bade
her leave all that behind, for the rich lands of Burgundy
yielded more than enough to satisfy the proudest
heart. The queen therefore opened her chests
full of gold and silver and divided them among her
knights and among the poor of her kingdom. Her
rich robes, and all the costly apparel she had worn,
she gave to her maidens, and arranged to take with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
her only a small part of her possessions. While
preparations were being made for the departure of
Brunhilde to the country of her liege lord and husband,
Hagen was fuming uneasily at the long delay,
and predicting all manner of misfortunes if they did
not speedily leave Isenland. Gunther tried to allay
his fears and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are restless, Hagen, because you are old,
and cannot share your lord&rsquo;s joy in having won this
peerless maiden for his queen. There is really no
cause for alarm, for the people here are friendly to
us now that I am their acknowledged king. Besides,
have we not Siegfried with us, and how can we fear
any harm when he is here to protect us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered Hagen, angrily, &ldquo;to be sure
we have Siegfried with us, but it is always Siegfried
whom we have to lean on like a babe on its mother.
Before he came among us, we ourselves were counted
warriors worthy to be feared; but now it is always
Siegfried who fights our battles, guides our ship,
and brings us out of all our difficulties. It is Siegfried,
too, who wins us a warrior maiden whom we
would never have conquered alone, weak and nerveless
men that we are. It is Siegfried, always Siegfried,
and I hate his very name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, now, good Hagen,&rdquo; said the king, soothingly,
&ldquo;these things should not provoke you to
jealousy, but rather make you hold the youth in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
respect and honour. What would Burgundy do without
Siegfried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just it,&rdquo; retorted Hagen, bitterly.
&ldquo;Burgundy is naught except as she holds this
foreign prince in her court. She boasts no warrior
so valiant, no soldier so dear to her people, as this
man who came to us a stranger. Better far that
he should return to his own country than to stay
longer among us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; answered Gunther; &ldquo;if Siegfried is
so beloved by our people, it is a greater reason for
his remaining with them.&rdquo; But Hagen shook his
head, and muttered something which the king did
not understand.</p>

<p>Everything was at last ready for Brunhilde&rsquo;s
departure, and she bade a sorrowful farewell to all
her household and to all the people of Isenland.
Then she embarked on the white-sailed ship with the
four Burgundian warriors. In a few days she was
far out of sight of the land she loved, and was being
borne toward a country unfamiliar and unwelcome.
For even though she had been forced to own herself
conquered in the games, Brunhilde had never been
willing to become Gunther&rsquo;s wife, or to go with him
to his home across the sea.</p>

<p>The voyage was quickly and pleasantly spent
to all except the queen, who sat upon the deck,
moody and silent, ignoring all Gunther&rsquo;s efforts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
to divert her. Siegfried felt happy at the thought
of returning to the beautiful Kriemhild, though
his heart was heavy with fear that the coming of
Brunhilde to Burgundy would bring trouble and
sorrow in its train. The evident dislike which the
queen felt for King Gunther boded no good for the
future to him or to his friends. Only toward Hagen
did she show any kindness, and her overtures of
friendship were, strange to say, very willingly met
by the grim, reserved man. She would talk for
hours with Hagen when no one else could get from
her a moment&rsquo;s notice, and the gray-haired old
warrior seemed ever ready to please and serve her.</p>

<p>At last the voyage was over, and the king was
again in his own land and among his own people.
Great rejoicing was made over his return, and
feasts were held for many days in honour of the wonderful
maiden who was now King Gunther&rsquo;s wife.
But though everything was done for her pleasure,
and many princes of the provinces of Burgundy
came to do homage to their queen, Brunhilde remained
ever moody and silent. The gentle Kriemhild
tried in vain to induce her to join in the feasting
and merriment, but Brunhilde refused, almost angrily,
and sat apart, brooding over her unhappy
lot. After a time Gunther sought his mother, Queen
Ute, and begged her to give Brunhilde some drink
which would make her forget Isenland, and so be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
content to dwell with him. Queen Ute shook her
head, and said sadly that she had nothing which
could accomplish this for him.</p>

<p class="caption">Gunther and Brunhilde arrive at Burgundy and are received by Kriemhild</p>
</div>

<p>The king went next to Hagen and said: &ldquo;You
have won Brunhilde&rsquo;s confidence, my uncle. Tell
me, therefore, why the queen is silent and unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Hagen laughed mockingly and whispered:
&ldquo;Ask your noble friend Siegfried whom you love
and trust so fully what it is that makes Brunhilde&rsquo;s
heart so heavy with longing, and so full of bitterness.
He can tell you far better than I.&rdquo; But shame and
pride forbade Gunther to go again with his troubles
to Siegfried, so he kept silent, and waited for time to
cure the queen&rsquo;s grief.</p>

<p>Things went on in this way for some time, for
nothing seemed to change the haughty queen, or
soften her dislike for all of Gunther&rsquo;s household
except Hagen. He remained her devoted follower,
and her one confidant and friend. Toward the
gentle Kriemhild she showed both jealousy and
aversion, though the sweet, friendly wife of Siegfried
was at a loss to understand the reason for her sister-in-law&rsquo;s
behaviour.</p>

<p>On his return to Burgundy, Siegfried had been
unwise enough to tell Kriemhild of the stratagem
by which he had won Brunhilde for the king, and
how later he had wrestled with the mighty queen,
and taken from her the magic girdle. He also gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
Kriemhild the serpent ring which Brunhilde had
prized more than all her possessions, but which she
had yielded when&mdash;as she supposed&mdash;Gunther had
outmatched her in strength. All this trickery Brunhilde
did not as yet even suspect, so Kriemhild
wondered at her ill-concealed hatred of the king.</p>

<p>One day Brunhilde and Kriemhild were walking
together in the palace garden, and as they were about
to enter the great feasting hall, Kriemhild, being a
little in advance of the queen, was just crossing the
doorway when Brunhilde called out angrily,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you presume to enter before me, your queen?
you who are the wife of a vassal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no vassal,&rdquo; retorted Kriemhild, quickly,
&ldquo;for Siegfried owns allegiance neither to you nor to
any other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a lie,&rdquo; cried Brunhilde, wrathfully, &ldquo;for
when Siegfried came to Isenland, he declared that
Gunther was his liege lord, and himself a humble
vassal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was only to save your pride,&rdquo; answered
Kriemhild, now dropping her angry tone, for she saw
that the queen was in a towering rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gunther deceived me, then,&rdquo; stormed Brunhilde,
furiously; then she added mockingly, &ldquo;Since Siegfried
is no vassal of the king&rsquo;s, I suppose he is a
much greater and richer prince; that he is braver
also, and stronger, and could outstrip the king in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
a contest of strength such as that in which Gunther
won me for his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; replied Kriemhild, &ldquo;for it was really
Siegfried who outdid you in the games, and not
Gunther at all. It was Siegfried, too, who wrested
from you the girdle and the ring, and he gave them
to me as a trophy dearly won.&rdquo; As she said this,
Kriemhild showed her two possessions and then
passed quietly into the hall, while Brunhilde stood
at the door too bewildered by her words to speak.</p>

<p>At length she realized the meaning of Kriemhild&rsquo;s
speech. Full of anger and fearful suspicion, she
sought out Hagen, and demanded that he should
tell her all he knew of Siegfried&rsquo;s part in the contest.
And Hagen told her how Siegfried had put on his
Tarnkappe and stood before the king unseen; how
he, and not Gunther, had flung the spear, and hurled
the stone and made the wonderful leap; how it was
Siegfried alone who had gained the victory, and he
who should rightfully have won her.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, Brunhilde wept in anger and
sorrow, and said bitterly: &ldquo;I might have known that
none but Siegfried could claim the warrior queen
for his bride. That fool and weakling, King Gunther,
is no mate for Brunhilde, and never would he have
called me wife had I not been tricked and deceived.
He is a coward, and merits all the hatred and contempt
I have shown him.&rdquo; Then her anger grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
fiercer than ever, and she swore vengeance upon
those who had wronged her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cherish not your wrath against the king,&rdquo; said
Hagen, &ldquo;for it is Siegfried who has brought this
shame upon you. He has been a source of evil
ever since he came among us, and he will yet be
the king&rsquo;s bane; yea, and thine also. It were better
that he died,&mdash;and soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall die,&rdquo; cried Brunhilde. &ldquo;I will call
Gunther hither and taunt him with his weakness
and cowardice. Then if he is a man, he will avenge
me of this insult which Kriemhild has put upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she summoned the king to her presence and
poured forth the story of her wrongs, bidding him
slay Siegfried if he ever hoped to merit anything but
her hatred and contempt. The king listened to her
words, but though he felt ashamed of the sorry part
he had played, he would not give her the promise
she desired, for he loved Siegfried, and could not
find it in his heart to kill him, even to win Brunhilde&rsquo;s
love.</p>

<p>Seeing that neither threats nor pleading would
move the king to do what she desired, Hagen begged
the queen to leave them, and give Gunther more
time to make his decision. So Brunhilde went away,
and when Hagen was sure that there was no danger
of her returning, he came close to the king and
whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
&ldquo;Blind fool that you are! Do you not see
even yet why the queen has been unhappy ever
since she came to Burgundy? She loves your friend
Siegfried, and it is he whom she would fain call
husband and lord!&rdquo; Then he left the king alone,
and Gunther sat for a long time thinking over what
Hagen had said. He felt discouraged and sick at
heart; for he knew that he was unable to solve the
difficulties before him, or to avert the dreadful fate
which seemed to be overshadowing him and all his
household.</p>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a>The Death of Siegfried</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>HORTLY after this Hagen came one day to the
king, and said: &ldquo;As long as Siegfried lives,
there is naught that will appease the wrath of
Brunhilde, or make her cease to weep. If you would
have peace for yourself and would win the queen&rsquo;s
love, it must be by Siegfried&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot slay him, Hagen,&rdquo; answered Gunther,
sadly; &ldquo;he is my friend, and also my brother,
and I cannot do such a treacherous thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no need for you to perform the deed
yourself. Only consent to having Siegfried killed,
and another hand than yours will carry it out. It
is useless to try and pacify the queen so long as
Siegfried lives to arouse daily her jealous wrath.
Consent, therefore, to his death,&rdquo; urged Hagen,
&ldquo;and I myself will slay him and take all the burden
of the guilt upon my shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For many hours he talked with the king, working
upon a weak will and unsteady purpose, and rousing
in Gunther the jealous fear that Siegfried would play
him false. There seemed, indeed, only one way out
of the difficulty, and at last Gunther consented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
Hagen&rsquo;s wish and promised to aid him in carrying
out his plans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I cannot win Brunhilde&rsquo;s love except by Siegfried&rsquo;s
death, then he had better die,&rdquo; cried the king;
&ldquo;for there is ever raging in my ears the queen&rsquo;s
words: &lsquo;Never will I live to be mocked by Kriemhild.
This thing must be ended by Siegfried&rsquo;s
death, or my death, or yours. Would that I were
again in Odin&rsquo;s hall&mdash;a shield-maiden starting for
battle or returning with my weapons stained with
red blood.&rsquo; Do what you will then, my uncle, for
I would lay down my life to win Brunhilde&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having won over the king, Hagen went away,
determined to avenge Brunhilde&rsquo;s wrongs and rid
the kingdom of one whom he had long feared and
hated. His plans were then quickly made. He remembered
that he had often heard it whispered
about the palace that some magic charm kept Siegfried
from ever being wounded in battle, since no
weapon had the power to harm him. So before he
could carry out his plans, he must learn with certainty
whether the report was true or false. There
was but one person who would be likely to know this;
and accordingly on a certain day when Siegfried
had gone hunting with the king, Hagen went to
Kriemhild, and seating himself beside her he inquired
kindly if she were very happy as the wife of
Siegfried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
Kriemhild looked surprised at this unexpected
visit from her uncle, for he seldom took any notice
of her; but she thought that he was prompted to a
show of interest in her by his fondness for Siegfried.
So she welcomed him gladly and answered his
question in a way to settle all doubts concerning
her happiness, had her uncle really felt any friendly
interest. Hagen smiled at her reply, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what will you do if Siegfried is wounded
in battle, and brought home dead upon his shield?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot happen,&rdquo; answered Kriemhild,
betrayed into further confidence by Hagen&rsquo;s seemingly
affectionate concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But such things do happen, even to the bravest
warrior,&rdquo; persisted Hagen, &ldquo;unless it be true, as I
have sometimes heard, that Siegfried is invulnerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not dreaming of his purpose in asking this question,
Kriemhild proudly replied, &ldquo;It is indeed
true, and that is why I have no fears when my
lord goes to battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was this great gift from Odin?&rdquo; asked Hagen.</p>

<p>Now Kriemhild knew that Siegfried had forbidden
her to speak of this matter to any one, but she
thought there could surely be no harm in revealing
the secret to one so devoted and loyal as her uncle,
so she told Hagen all about the slaying of Fafnir.
She said also that Siegfried had been bathed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
dragon&rsquo;s blood, and that this was supposed to render
him invulnerable.</p>

<img src="images/snm11.jpg" width="534" height="600"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">Siegfried and Kriemhild</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Was he completely covered by the stream of
blood?&rdquo; asked Hagen, with great interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Kriemhild, &ldquo;he was bathed
from head to foot, except one small spot upon his
shoulder, on which a leaf happened to fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid that he may be struck in that
place by a spear or arrow, and so meet his death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might indeed be so,&rdquo; said Kriemhild, &ldquo;but I
do not fear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; persisted Hagen, &ldquo;it would be well to
have some one always near Siegfried in battle, to
guard him against any death-blow, and since I
alone know of his point of weakness, let me be the
one to protect him. This service I shall be better
able to render if you will sew a mark upon his coat
over the exact spot on his shoulder where the leaf
fell, so that when we are beset by enemies upon the
road, or go forth to battle, I may keep beside him
and shield him from a possible death blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kriemhild was greatly moved by this evidence
of loyalty in Hagen, and thanking him warmly for
his devotion, she promised to sew upon Siegfried&rsquo;s
coat some mark by which the vulnerable spot could
be known. Then she hurried away to begin her
task, not dreaming of Hagen&rsquo;s wicked purpose in
obtaining her secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
Some days later Hagen proposed that there
should be a great hunt given in one of the neighbouring
forests, and Gunther, who had promised to
aid him in his plans, urged Siegfried to accompany
them. Siegfried gladly consented, for he had
greatly enjoyed this sport since his first coming to
Burgundy, and had spent many a pleasant hour
with Gunther and his knights in search of deer or
fox, or the fierce wild boar. In all of these expeditions
he had been foremost in the hunt, and had
usually borne off the prize, both in the size and number
of his game. His spear was sharp, and shone
brightly as he rode along, mounted on the faithful
Greyfel, and his aim was so quick and sure that his
weapon never missed its mark, but went straight
to the heart of the beast he was pursuing. This
superiority in the chase added much to Hagen&rsquo;s
anger and jealousy, for as Siegfried had proved himself
the greatest of warriors on the battle-field, so in
the hunt he was the peer of all the knights of Burgundy.</p>

<p>A day was set for the great hunt, and a forest
was chosen which was famous for the number
and fierceness of its wild beasts. Then early one
morning Gunther, Hagen and Siegfried set forth
with their knights, in full expectation of having a
profitable as well as exciting day. It was a beautiful
morning in early spring, and the spirits of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
hunting party rose high as they cantered out of the
city gates and made their way toward the forest.</p>

<p>Siegfried rode ahead of the party, with Gunther
and Hagen beside him. His suit was of royal
purple, embroidered richly by Kriemhild&rsquo;s loving
fingers, and his spear shone bright in the sunlight
as he galloped along, light-hearted and unsuspicious of
the black thoughts which were harboured in Hagen&rsquo;s
wicked heart. He looked so brave and joyous, so
beautiful as a youth and so gallant as a knight, that
all the warriors in Gunther&rsquo;s train said among themselves
that no one in Burgundy was fit to be compared
to Siegfried.</p>

<p>These remarks soon came to Hagen&rsquo;s ears, and
hardened him in his determination to slay this
foreign prince whom all his own countrymen would
so gladly make their king in place of the weak and
unwarlike Gunther. He hid this feeling, however,
and kept close to Siegfried&rsquo;s side, looking eagerly
for the spot upon his shoulder where the loving but
foolish Kriemhild had sewed the fatal mark.</p>

<p>The hunting party soon came to the edge of
the forest, where they divided into three groups.
Each leader took with him a party of followers,
and they set out in different directions, with the
agreement that when the sun was overhead they
should meet at a well-known place where Gunther
had arranged that their dinner was to be set out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
Siegfried galloped away, and a greater part of the
knights followed him. Hagen saw this and frowned
darkly, but he said nothing, only waited for Siegfried
to get out of sight. Then he whispered to the
king:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day is the day for our deed. This must be
the last time that your friend Siegfried flaunts his
superiority over the king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gunther trembled and answered weakly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must it be done, Hagen? Is there no other
way to rid our kingdom of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way but by his death,&rdquo; replied Hagen,
firmly; then he added: &ldquo;and do not you give way
to foolish fancies, or my plans may fail. I have
no womanish scruples, and Siegfried must die
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not wishing to have it appear that anything
unusual was in preparation, Hagen ceased to confer
with the king, but summoned his knights to
the chase, and, putting spurs to their horses, they
started through the forest. But something in the
faces of the leaders made the men only half-hearted
in their eagerness for the hunt, and a spirit of
silence and gloom spread over the whole party.</p>

<p>They hunted all the morning, but their success
was small, and when they finally drew up at the
meeting-place, they found that they had very little
game to boast of. The men had already come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
from the castle with great baskets of provisions,
so the knights dismounted, and sat upon the grass
to await the coming of Siegfried.</p>

<p>Soon they heard the loud blast of horns, and the
joyous hallooing of men mingled with the barking
and yelping of hounds; and in a moment Siegfried
and his followers came in sight. They shouted
merrily to their comrades, and galloped forward
to join them, while those seated upon the ground
looked with delight and surprise at the beasts
which had been slain by Siegfried&rsquo;s skilful hand.
There was a large black bear of the kind which
was known to be so fierce that it was well-nigh
impossible to kill or capture him. There was also
a huge wild boar and three shaggy wolves, besides
a great number of smaller animals, such as the
fox and deer. The knights were all loud in their
praises of Siegfried&rsquo;s wonderful skill, and he took
their homage gladly, seeming wholly unconscious
of Hagen&rsquo;s cruel face or Gunther&rsquo;s averted eyes.</p>

<p>Soon the midday feast was ready, and the men
sat down to eat. Some of the game they had caught
that morning was roasted and placed before them,
and they ate almost greedily, for the sport had given
them sufficient excuse for hunger. Presently Gunther
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no wine to accompany our meat? To
eat without drinking is but a poor way to feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
The attendant to whom he spoke answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no wine provided, my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; demanded the king, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Prince Hagen&rsquo;s command,&rdquo; replied the
servant, humbly, and at this Hagen interposed,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should the king ask for wine when not
a hundred rods away is a beautiful stream more
clear and sparkling than the finest wine? Let us
go there and quench our thirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Gunther; &ldquo;and for my part,
I am satisfied with the drink you offer. It remains
for my guest to declare himself content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Siegfried rose and exclaimed eagerly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that fear weighs upon you, let me prove
how little you should cherish it. I will go first
to the stream, and come and tell you how pure and
sweet is its water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me show you the way, then,&rdquo; said Hagen,
and as he and Siegfried moved away together, he
asked hesitatingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you run a race with me, Sir Siegfried, to
see which of us will reach the stream first? For
though I am much older than you in years, I was
accounted a famous runner in my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; replied Siegfried; and they started
off toward the stream. But although Hagen went
with wonderful swiftness considering his years,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
he could not outrun the fleet-footed Siegfried, who
reached the goal some minutes before Hagen came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are truly a swift runner, even now, friend
Hagen,&rdquo; he cried gayly, &ldquo;and I can easily believe
your boast that you were once the most famous
runner in the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Hagen smiled and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are we poor men, even the best of
us, beside the noble Siegfried, who can outstrip all
the warriors of Burgundy, no matter what the
contest may be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, you are overzealous in your praise,&rdquo;
laughed Siegfried, but he was pleased with Hagen&rsquo;s
friendly words, for he did not detect the undertone
of jealousy and anger. Then courteously
he bade Hagen drink of the stream, but Hagen
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you drink first, and let me follow you,
for though you would yield the courtesy to me because
of my age, I would rather give precedence
to you as the better runner. Drink, therefore, but
first lay aside your armour, for the weight of it might
throw you into the stream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siegfried, ever trustful and unsuspicious, threw
off his coat of mail and laid his spear beside it, thus
leaving unprotected the inner coat on which Kriemhild
had sewed the fatal mark. Then he knelt upon
the ground, and stooping over put his hand into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
stream and prepared to raise the water to his lips.
At this moment Hagen, with catlike swiftness,
caught up Siegfried&rsquo;s shining spear, and, aiming it
directly toward the mark, hurled it with all his force.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

bed. <a href="#FNanchor_58_58">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The weapon sank into the stooping body, and
with a groan Siegfried rolled over upon the ground.
As soon as he was able, he turned to see who had
done this cowardly deed; and only when he saw
Hagen fleeing in guilty haste, could he believe that
the blow was dealt by one who so lately seemed
his friend. Siegfried put his hand feebly to his
shoulder, and when he found where the spear had
struck, he knew that his wound was mortal. He
made one great effort to rise, and gathering together
all his strength, he drew out the spear and started
in pursuit of Hagen.</p>

<p>The treacherous murderer had fled for protection
to the king, and thither Siegfried followed him;
but before he reached the astonished and horror-stricken
group who were watching his approach,
the blood began to gush forth from his wound, and
he sank helplessly to the ground. The whole company
of knights knelt down beside him, weeping
and lamenting over the loss of their leader. One
of them raised the dying hero&rsquo;s head and placed it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
upon his knee, while others tried to stanch the blood
from his wound. Siegfried, however, bade them
cease their efforts, for his end had now come.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Hagen, and upbraided him for
his cowardly deed, and for his treachery in obtaining
the secret of his vulnerability from Kriemhild to use
it in such a dastardly way. His strength was now
almost exhausted, and his eyes began to close; but
suddenly he roused again, and said to the trembling
and terrified king:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast played a coward&rsquo;s part to thy friend
who trusted thee, O Gunther, and some day thou
wilt bitterly repent of having aided thine uncle in
his wickedness. But for this I will not reproach
thee, for thou art already sorrowing. One thing
only I ask of thee, and do thou promise it, and
make what amends thou canst. Take care of thy
sister Kriemhild, and do not let Hagen&rsquo;s vengeance
extend to her. Though thou hast proved an unworthy
friend to me, yet I commend my wife to thy
keeping. Wilt thou swear to protect and cherish
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; replied Gunther, now weeping remorseful
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then see that thou play the man, nay, be for
once the king, and keep thine oath to the dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he finished these words, Siegfried sank back
lifeless into the arms of the knight who supported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
him. All at once the clouds overhead grew fearfully
dark, and the air seemed full of a strange,
ominous stillness. The birds stopped their singing,
and the forest was silent with the hush of
night. The warriors stood weeping beside the
body of their slain leader, but no one dared to
speak. Slowly and sadly they raised Siegfried
from the ground; and, placing him on their shoulders,
bore him to the place where the faithful Greyfel
was standing, patiently awaiting the coming
of his master. One of the knights led the horse,
while a solemn group of mourners followed, and
not even the sternest old warrior among them felt
ashamed of the tears he shed for the dead hero.</p>

<p>When the sorrowful procession reached the city
gates, the news was quickly spread that Siegfried
was slain, and by the hand of Hagen. There was
great mourning throughout the city, and beneath
the wail of sorrow was a muttered undertone of
threats towards the man who could do such a cowardly
and treacherous thing as to kill the friend
who trusted him. But Hagen faced the people,
calm and grim as ever, and said boldly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let all the guilt of this deed rest upon me,
for it was by my hand that Siegfried died. Now
there is but one lord of Burgundy, King Gunther,
and no longer shall Brunhilde sit in tears, for the
insult put upon her is avenged.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26"></a>The Last of the Hoard</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HOUGH the news of the death of Siegfried
had spread throughout the city, no one dared to
bring the dreadful tidings to Kriemhild, who sat
in her bower with her maidens, waiting her lord&rsquo;s
return. The day was now far spent, and she began
to wonder at his long delay, when the sound of some
disturbance in the street reached her chamber windows,
and she looked out to see what the unusual
noise might be. At first she feared it was an outbreak
of war, but the solemn procession which was
wending its way toward the palace was not martial
in its bearing, but full of the awful stillness of a
funeral march. She saw that some one was being
borne on the shoulders of the men&mdash;some one dead&mdash;and
the others were his mourning followers.
She wondered who it could be, and why they were
bringing him to the palace.</p>

<p>Among the group of knights who formed the
funeral train, she presently discerned the figures
of Gunther and Hagen, and she began to tremble
with fear and dread foreboding when she saw that
Siegfried was not with them. She strained her eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
to see if she could recognize the features of the dead,
but she was too far away, and could not see; so
she waited fearfully by the window, while the procession
wound its way through the courtyard, and
then into the great hall. Unable to bear the suspense
any longer, she left the room and hurried down
to meet her brother and learn tidings of Siegfried.
But the moment she entered the hall, the faces of
the men told her all she wished to know, and she did
not need to inquire who the dead might be.</p>

<p>Every one in the palace shared the grief of Siegfried&rsquo;s
gentle wife, and all the city mourned with her
in the loss of one so greatly beloved as the hero whom
Hagen called a &ldquo;stranger.&rdquo; As long as the first
shock of Siegfried&rsquo;s tragic death engrossed all of
Kriemhild&rsquo;s thought and feeling, she did not realize
the part which Hagen had played in the event; but
as the days went by and she had time to think of all
that had gone before, she remembered how her
uncle had traitorously obtained the secret of Siegfried&rsquo;s
vulnerable spot from her, and how she herself
had, at his request, sewed the fatal mark upon her
husband&rsquo;s coat. She had heard that it was by
Hagen&rsquo;s hand that Siegfried met his death, yet
she could not believe him guilty of such a terrible
deed. So one day she went weeping to Hagen, and
asked him to tell her by whom Siegfried was slain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story of such things is not for a woman&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
ears,&rdquo; replied Hagen, &ldquo;and whether he died by my
hand or another&rsquo;s is of small moment. It was the
will of the Norns, who rule the life of every man,
that he should die, and their decrees no one of us
can change or avert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the day was set for the great funeral fires
to be lit, all the princes of Burgundy came to attend
the solemn festival, and sought to do homage
to the dead hero by bringing rich gifts to be laid upon
the funeral pyre. This imposing structure was
erected in front of the palace, and on the appointed
day the foremost lords of Gunther&rsquo;s household
brought the body of Siegfried from the palace where
it had lain in state, and placed it sorrowfully upon
the funeral pyre. Beside him was laid his armour and
his magic Tarnkappe, and last of all the famous
sword Balmung. The king had ordered that Greyfel
be carefully guarded for fear that if he were brought
upon the scene, he would leap into the flames and
perish with his master.</p>

<p>Around these things, which were sacred to the
memory of Siegfried, the princes of Burgundy
piled their most costly gifts, and everything was
ready for the fires to be lit. But no one of Gunther&rsquo;s
men could bear to place a torch to the wood,
and a dreadful stillness fell over the whole assembly.
At length Hagen came boldly forward and laid a
burning brand to the pile of logs which formed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
funeral pyre. In a moment the whole structure
was ablaze, and the hungry flames leaped upward
toward the sky.</p>

<p>Gunther stood by, trembling and fearful, lest
Odin should send some terrible retribution upon the
one who had slain his chosen hero. Kriemhild,
weeping, hid her face in her hands, for she could
not watch the dreadful fires. On the faces of all
the watchers was reflected a great sorrow, for no
prince of Burgundy was so dear to them as Siegfried,
even though he came from a foreign land. Only
Hagen showed no grief or any sign of repentance
for his deed, but stood by unmoved, like a grim,
avenging god.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a figure appeared in their midst,
wild and dishevelled, and seemingly mad with grief.
It was Brunhilde, once a Valkyrie, come to claim
her slain. Turning to the astonished group of
mourners, she cried exultingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, you people of Burgundy, for the last
time upon your queen whom you have ever seen
fulfilling the common lot of mortal woman, and
know that I was once a shield-maiden, one of Odin&rsquo;s
Valkyries. I was condemned to eternal sleep by
the great All-father, but was rescued by Siegfried,
the hero who knows no fear. And here he lies who
rode through the wall of fire to waken me, and who
won me in the games by his godlike strength, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
your cowardly King Gunther made false claim to
me. Here lies Siegfried, the chosen hero of Odin
and the true mate of Odin&rsquo;s warrior maiden. Therefore
for him alone does Brunhilde own her love, and
to him alone will she be wed. The Valkyrie yields
only to the greatest hero.&rdquo; Saying this she leaped
upon the funeral pyre, and in a moment had perished
beside Siegfried in the flames.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

In the Volsunga Saga, Brunhilde kills herself with a sword. <a href="#FNanchor_59_59">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>And what of the ill-fated hoard upon which still
rested Andvari&rsquo;s curse?</p>

<p>When the shock of the terrible events connected
with Siegfried&rsquo;s death was over, and quiet was
once more restored to Gunther&rsquo;s palace, Hagen
came one day to the king and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember that Siegfried gave all of his
treasure to Kriemhild on their wedding day, and
although the hoard was never brought to Burgundy
it still remains in the possession of your sister.
Entreat her, therefore, to have it conveyed
here; and, to accomplish your end more easily, tell
her that she can honour Siegfried&rsquo;s memory by
distributing his wealth among the poor. When
we get the treasure into our hands, we will see, however,
that nothing so foolish is done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weak-willed Gunther, always under the control
of Hagen, accordingly sought Kriemhild and
told her what great things could be done in honour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
of Siegfried, if only the treasure in the dragon&rsquo;s
cave could be placed at her disposal. Kriemhild
was not suspicious of her brother, for she did not
know what part he had played in Siegfried&rsquo;s death,
so she listened readily to his words, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be done even as you say, for naught can
now bring me solace in my grief save some way to
make the name of Siegfried dearer to the hearts of
the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she handed Gunther the serpent ring which
Siegfried had given her, and told him where to find
the famous hoard in the cave of Glistenheath.
She bade him keep the ring carefully, for Andvari
might again have taken possession of the treasure,
though he would yield it to the wearer of the ring.</p>

<p>The king took the ring from Kriemhild, and hastened
with it to Hagen, who at once set to work to
make preparations for conveying the hoard to Burgundy.
In a few days a great number of wagons
were fitted up, and with these a hundred men were
despatched to gather all the treasure and bring it
back to the palace. Although most of the men were
Hagen&rsquo;s own followers, he could not trust them to go
alone on this important mission, so he placed Siegfried&rsquo;s
ring upon his own finger and led the expedition
himself.</p>

<p>The hoard was found securely stowed away in
Fafnir&rsquo;s cave, and not a single piece of gold had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
been taken since Siegfried rode away after slaying
the dragon. The dwarf Andvari still guarded the
treasure which had once been his; but when Hagen
showed the serpent ring, he allowed the stranger
to enter the cave. He would have preferred to
deliver the hoard to Siegfried himself, but the possession
of the serpent ring made its wearer the rightful
owner of all the treasure. So Andvari was obliged
to admit Hagen&rsquo;s claim, and assist him in bearing
away the gold.</p>

<p>Some days later, the company which had set out
from Gunther&rsquo;s palace empty-handed came back
laden with such wealth of gold and precious stones
that all the riches of Burgundy seemed nothing in
comparison. This great hoard was stored safely
in Gunther&rsquo;s palace, and Kriemhild was very glad
to find so much wealth at her disposal.</p>

<p>She became very lavish in her gifts, and eager
to pour out all her riches, if only it brought added
honour upon Siegfried&rsquo;s memory. No one who came
to beg alms of her ever went away empty-handed,
and the palace was always full of suppliants for
her bounty. This extravagant giving went on
for some time, until one day Hagen came to the
king and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your sister continues to distribute so much
gold among the people, we will soon have them
idle and rebellious, and then they will be useless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
to us in time of warfare. Bid her, therefore, to cease
her giving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Gunther answered, &ldquo;I have brought enough
sorrow upon her through my evil deeds, and if this
lavish giving can soften her grief, let her continue
to dispose of her wealth as it pleases her, even
though she should exhaust all the treasure that is
in the hoard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hagen determined, however, that it must not be
so, and seeing that he could get no help from the
king, he planned to gain his end by other means.
So he made every appearance of approving Kriemhild&rsquo;s
lavish gifts, and in time prevailed upon her
to give him access to the treasure, that he might
help her in disposing of it. Then one dark night
he gathered together a band of his own followers,
and stole all that remained of the hoard. They
carried it from the palace by a secret passage, and
brought it down to the river, where Hagen sunk it
many fathoms deep. Neither he nor any one else
could ever regain it, but at least it was out of Kriemhild&rsquo;s
hands.</p>

<p>Thus was the hoard of Andvari, with its fateful
curse, placed forever beyond the reach of men; but
the charm and the mystery which hung around its
very name still lingered through all the centuries
that followed, and to-day the sailors upon the river
Rhine are still looking for some glimpse of the sunken
treasure.</p>

<h2><a name="chap27" id="chap27"></a>The Punishment of Loki</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE curse which the dwarf Andvari had placed
upon the hoard, and particularly upon the
serpent ring which Loki had wrested from
him, did not end with the sinking of the treasure in
the river. Both Hagen and Kriemhild had been
wearers of the ring, and evil soon fell upon them as
it had upon Fafnir, Regin, Siegfried and Brunhilde.
Some years after Siegfried&rsquo;s death, Kriemhild married
Etzel, king of the Huns, and was slain by one of his
knights. Before this, however, she herself had
struck the blow that killed the treacherous and cruel
Hagen. With the burial of Kriemhild, the ill-fated
ring passed forever from the sight of men, and the
curse of Andvari was never again visited upon its
unfortunate possessors.</p>

<p>Any other of the gods than Loki would have regretted
the greed which made him tear the serpent
ring from Andvari&rsquo;s finger, and thus bring misfortune
upon so many innocent people; but Loki
did not care whether human lives were wrecked by
his misdoing any more than he felt one moment&rsquo;s
remorse for having slain the shining Balder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
The gods had never forgiven Loki for this wicked
deed, and they longed very much to drive him out of
their beautiful city, which had never harboured any
other evil thing. But Loki was Odin&rsquo;s brother, and
they dared not punish him until the All-Wise One
was ready to give his consent. Odin knew as well
as they, that the slayer of Balder was not fit to live
among the gods; but he waited for Loki to commit
one more act of cruelty before he drove the offender
out of Asgard. This occasion came, at last, sooner
than Odin expected.</p>

<p>One day all the gods were invited to a feast in the
halls of &AElig;ger, the sea-king; and a bounteous supply
of ale was brewed in the great kettle that Thor had
brought from Hymer&rsquo;s castle. Thor was not present
at the feast, for he had been obliged to go on a long
journey; but Loki was there, looking sullen and
angry. No one spoke to him, and he sat silent and
alone, trying to appear indifferent to the hostile
looks that were directed toward him.</p>

<p>The palace of the sea-god was very beautiful,
with its walls and ceiling made of mother-of-pearl so
delicately laid that the light filtered softly through
it. On the floor was strewn the finest golden sand,
and all the food was placed in opal-tinted sea-shells.
The only thing that marred the beauty of the scene
was Loki&rsquo;s ugly, wicked face.</p>

<p>As the meal progressed and the gods grew merry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
over their cups, they almost forgot the presence of
the unwelcome guest; but Loki brooded in angry
silence, waiting for some chance to wreak his ill-will
upon the whole company. A servant stopped beside
him to refill his horn with the foaming ale;
and one of the gods, as he watched this, said to old
&AElig;ger: &ldquo;Your servants have been well instructed.
They are as careful to wait upon Loki as if he were
an honoured guest.&rdquo; When Loki heard these words,
he flew into a mad rage; and, seizing a knife that
was lying on the table, he struck the unoffending
servant dead.</p>

<p>At this wanton cruelty the gods sat speechless;
but Odin rose, looking stern and awful in his wrath,
and with a relentless voice he bade Loki be gone.
&ldquo;Never dare to tread our sacred halls again, nor
pollute the pure air of Asgard with your presence,&rdquo;
he cried. So terrible did Odin look that Loki slunk
away out of the hall, and the gods returned again
to their feasting. Soon a great noise was heard outside
the hall, and all the servants came running in,
looking very much frightened. Behind them walked
Loki, who came boldly up to the table and dared
Odin to send him out before he had spoken the words
he had come back to say.</p>

<p>Then he began to talk to each one of the gods in
turn, telling them of all the foolish or mean or wicked
things they had ever done&mdash;ridiculing their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
mistakes, and laying bare all their faults in such a dishonest
way that each small offence seemed an act
of monstrous wickedness. Not content with trying
to shame the heroes of Asgard, Loki began to speak
slightingly of the goddesses; and attributed to them
all the hateful things that his malicious imagination
could invent. He was just telling some shameful
lie about Sif when a rumbling of chariot wheels was
heard outside, and in a moment Thor rushed into
the hall brandishing his hammer. He had heard
Loki&rsquo;s last words, and he made straight for the
slanderer, intending to crush him with one blow of
Mj&ouml;lner. Loki, however, quickly changed himself
into a sea-serpent, and slid out of the room before
Thor&rsquo;s vengeful hammer could descend upon his head.</p>

<p>Taking his own shape, he made his way to the
mountains of the north, and there he built a hut with
four doors, opening north, east, south and west,
so that he could see any one approaching and could
easily make his escape. The hut was close beside
a swift mountain stream, and here Loki spent many
days in fishing&mdash;for there was little else to do to
beguile the long hours. Remembering how easy it
had been to catch Andvari after he had obtained
the help of Ran, Loki made himself a net like the
one which he had borrowed from the ocean queen.
It took him a long time to weave the net; and one
day, just as it was nearly finished, he saw two figures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
standing on the brow of the hill. He did not need
a nearer view to tell him that the tall forms so clearly
outlined against the sky were those of Thor and
Odin. He knew that they had come to punish him for
his many evil deeds; but he did not intend to be
caught without making every possible effort to
escape. So he threw the net which he was making
into the fire, and, hurrying down to the stream, he
quickly changed himself into a salmon.</p>

<p>When Odin and Thor reached the hut where they
knew Loki had been in hiding, they found that he
had escaped them. Then Thor by chance stumbled
over the logs on the hearth, and, in doing so, he discovered
the half-burnt net. Picking it up, he cried
to Odin: &ldquo;So this is what our crafty Loki has been
doing to fill his idle hours. There must be some
brook near by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Odin, &ldquo;and that is where he has
just gone. He has changed himself into a fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two gods went to the mountain stream,
and there they saw a salmon lurking in the depths
of a pool. Odin had already mended the burnt net
so that it was serviceable, and he quickly threw
it over the fish which was now darting here and
there among the rocks. He did not catch the wily
salmon, however, for it slid into a narrow opening
between two stones. Then Odin cast again, and
this time the fish gave a great leap over the net
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
and darted up the stream. Determined that the
tricky Loki should not outwit them, Odin and Thor
followed the salmon a long distance until the stream
finally narrowed into a tiny rivulet. The salmon
now gave another leap into the air in a vain effort
to escape the enclosing net which Odin threw over
it. Then, finding itself caught, with incredible
quickness it began to work its way through the
meshes of the net, and would have slid out of the
gods&rsquo; hands had not Thor suddenly caught it by the
tail. Since that time, so the story goes, all salmon
have their tails pointed.</p>

<p>Odin now changed Loki into his proper form, and
he and Thor dragged the wicked god to a cave in
the mountain. Here they bound Loki hand and
foot with iron chains, and fastened these firmly to
the rock. Then Odin placed over his head a venomous
serpent which dropped its poison upon the face
of the fettered god, causing him great pain. So,
chained and suffering, he lay there in the cave, unpitied
by either gods or men. Only Sigyn, his
faithful wife, felt any sorrow for his pain, and she
sat always beside him to catch the venom in a cup
so that it should not fall on the captive&rsquo;s face.
When she was obliged to turn away to empty the
cup, the drops of poison fell upon Loki, and he shook
and writhed so terribly in his agony that the whole
earth trembled.</p>

So Loki lay chained in the cave until the day
when, according to the decree of the Norns, he was
allowed to break his fetters and become the leader
in that terrible battle which ushered in the last
great day&mdash;Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods.</p>

<h2><a name="chap28" id="chap28"></a>The Twilight of the Gods</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE gods hoped that when Loki was bound fast,
there would be peace in Asgard, and an end to
mischief-making on the earth. Odin knew,
however, that the time was almost at hand when the end
of all things would come; and while gods and men rejoiced
in the universal happiness, Odin&rsquo;s face was
full of sadness. He had given to the earth and to
Asgard a brief respite from trouble by chaining the
wicked Loki to the rock, but he felt that the day of
reckoning was near.</p>

<p>The first warning Odin had of the nearness of that
day was when a sudden deadly cold spread over all
the earth, and he knew it was the beginning of that
long, long winter which had been foretold by the
writing in the runes. So sharp and long-continued
was the cold that it chilled the hearts of men, and
even crept upward to touch the robes of those who
dwelt in the eternal springtime of Asgard. Though
all the earth shuddered under the winter&rsquo;s icy hand,
people everywhere took comfort in saying, &ldquo;It will
soon be over and then the warm days will come.&rdquo;
But they waited day after day and week after week
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
until the season came which should have been
summer, but still the snow and frost and chill kept
the world fast bound. Not a flower bloomed nor
a tree budded nor any green thing appeared above
the frozen ground. Yet the folk of Midgard still
hoped on, and waited for the summer that never
came. The terrible winter<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> lasted for three years,
and everywhere the dead were numbered by thousands.
No food was to be had except what by
chance had been stored away, for nothing could
grow in the land where ice and snow lay always
thick upon the ground. Knowing that they had
but a short time to live, men fought and killed each
other for the mere love of bloodshed, and no one tried
to restrain the crime and wickedness that stalked
unmolested through the streets. The gods looked
down from Asgard at the desolation on the earth,
and they sorrowed greatly to see men trying to drown
their fears or buy forgetfulness in deeds of violence
and brutish pleasure. Only the frost-giants rejoiced
over the long destructive winter, for they had
always wished to see the whole world wrapped in
fog and cold like their own dreary J&ouml;tunheim.
They turned their envious eyes toward Asgard, and
waited in grim certainty that the rule of the gods
was soon to end.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_60_60">[60]</a></span>
It is called in the old Norse the Fimbul winter. <a href="#FNanchor_60_60">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>There was still some warmth in Asgard, for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
of the sun&rsquo;s rays were turned toward the sacred
city; but Odin knew that they had but a short time
in which to enjoy this scant comfort. The two
gray wolves that were ever pursuing Sol and Mani
were fed, during the long winter, by a frost-giantess;
and one dreadful day they rushed after the chariots
of the sun and moon with such unlooked-for swiftness
that they at last overtook the shining cars and
devoured the charioteers. Soon a thick darkness
spread over all the world, and when the last gleam
of light faded from the sky, all the evil things that
had lain hidden for fear of the gods, or that wished
to live away from the light,&mdash;all these came boldly
forth from caves and dark forests and holes underground,
for they knew that their time had come at
last.</p>

<p>Then a terrible rending sound was heard as if
the very foundations of the earth were being broken
up. There was a rushing noise like the outpouring
of all the seas, and a trampling as of a million feet.
The Midgard serpent reared its horrid head above
the waves, and then drew its huge coils from around
the earth, creeping slowly from the sea to the land.
The Fenris wolf broke his chains, and sprang with
a fierce leap to the rock on the mountain where Loki
lay bound. With the help of Fenrer, the fettered
god tore himself free of his chains, and roamed over
the earth with the great wolf at his side, gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
together all the hosts of evil that were eager to war
against the gods.</p>

<p>From J&ouml;tunheim came an army of frost-giants
ready to fight with their old enemy in a last great
battle; and out of Muspelheim marched a troop of
fire-giants under the leadership of Surter, who carried
a flaming sword. Through a deep cleft in the earth
Hel crept stealthily out of her silent halls; and behind
her trooped thousands and thousands of
dusky shapes that would never have dared to come
up into the light of day. The Midgard serpent,
pouring forth poison from his ever-open mouth,
spread his great length across the stricken land, and
glided on to the plain called Vigrid where Loki had
gathered together a vast and hideous array. A cry
like the howling of wolves rose up from the plain,
and it beat in the ears of those who were waiting
behind the walls of Asgard. It was a cry full of
hatred and defiance, and when the gods heard it they
knew that the challenge could not go unanswered.
Sadly&mdash;for each felt it was the end&mdash;they prepared
themselves for battle; and, while they made
ready, the frost-giants determined to avenge themselves
by taking possession of Asgard. So, before
Heimdall could sound his horn to warn the gods of
the approaching enemy, they began to rush across
the rainbow bridge that led to the coveted city.
They came in such numbers and with such violence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
that Bifrost broke beneath the heavy tramp of feet,
and the frost-giants were obliged to return to the
plain Vigrid and wait for the coming battle.</p>

<p>The gods, with Odin at their head, marched bravely
out of Asgard to meet the great host of evil things
which had leagued together to destroy them. Then
a terrible battle was fought, the like of which had
never been seen on the earth before, nor ever will
be again. Though the gods fought with the courage
of despair, they knew that it was useless to contend
with the fury and strength and numbers that were
arrayed against them. One by one the shining heroes
of Asgard fell beneath the attacks of the madly
exultant foe, and even the mighty Mj&ouml;lner was
powerless to avert the doom which had been decreed
by fate.</p>

<p>Thor struggled fiercely with the Midgard serpent,
and though he killed it at last with his hammer,
the terrible coils closed slowly about him and he was
drowned in the flood of venom that poured out of
the dying creature&rsquo;s mouth. Loki slew Heimdall;
but not before the gods&rsquo; faithful watchman had
dealt the leader of the evil hosts a mortal blow.
Odin engaged in a deadly combat with the Fenris
wolf, and was at last torn to pieces by Fenrer&rsquo;s
terrible teeth and claws. Seeing the greatest of
the gods so brutally killed, Vidar, Odin&rsquo;s son, sprang
upon the wolf, and with the strength born of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
madness and despair, struck the great brute dead.
Surter, the fire giant, rushed quickly at Freyr, and
destroyed the bright god with his flaming sword.
Then he threw fire and flames over all the earth,
and soon everything was consumed in the terrible
conflagration that followed. Ygdrasil, the Tree
of Life, withered up and was caught by the wildly
leaping flames. The great tree burned like a dry
twig; and when the last leaf fluttered feebly toward
the encroaching fire, the high walls around Asgard
fell with a crash to the ground, and let in the devouring
flames. The stars dropped one by one into
the sea, darkness reigned over all the world, and time
itself seemed blotted out forever.</p>

<p>Then silence and the brooding night took possession
of the universe, and this lasted many, many
years; but in time a new heaven and a new earth
emerged from the chaos that followed the destruction
of Asgard. The sun shone again in the clear
sky, and the moon and the stars once more shed their
soft light on the earth. The flowers bloomed as
gayly as before, and the fields were thick with ripening
grain. Then, when the earth was ready for
another race of men, a certain man and woman
who had lain all these years asleep in the depths of
a cave, awoke. They looked with delight upon an
earth made fresh and new, and to them and to their
children it was given as an everlasting possession.</p>

<p class="xlrgfont">The Winds of Deal</p>

<p class="centerlrgsc">By LATTA GRISWOLD</p>

<p class="center">Author of &ldquo;Deering of Deal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deering at Princeton&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">With Illustrations by <span class="smcap">George Harper</span></p>

<p>That there are few men better qualified to write school stories than Latta
Griswold has been amply demonstrated by that author&rsquo;s previous books. Here,
in &ldquo;The Winds of Deal,&rdquo; he tells another tale quite as stirring as its predecessors.
Deal School, the <i>locale</i> of his first work, &ldquo;Deering of Deal,&rdquo; is again the
scene, while Tony Deering himself once more figures in the action, though he
is not the character of chief importance. That person is one George Erroll, a
most likable chap and a very human creation, too. In the narrative of his adventures
Mr. Griswold has splendidly caught the spirit of school life with its
friendships, its trials, its tribulations as well as its successes.</p>

<p class="xlrgfont">Hoof and Claw</p>

<p class="centerlrgsc">By CHARLES G.&nbsp;D. ROBERTS</p>

<p class="center">With Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Paul Bransom</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the faithful guidance of Mr. Roberts,&rdquo; the editor of the <i>London
Athen&aelig;um</i> once wrote, &ldquo;we have ventured among the wild beasts of land and
sea; and we hope to do so many times in the future. It is an education not
to be missed by those who have the chance, and the chance is every one&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hoof and Claw&rdquo; is another of those books for which Mr. Roberts is so justly
famous, a book much like the one referred to in the preceding sentences. In
it are told more than a dozen stories of animals. Mr. Roberts writes with an
understanding of the nature of the creatures of field and forest that is nothing
short of marvelous, an appreciation of the wild life that has seldom if ever
found its equal in literature. Among the titles of the tales in his latest collection
are &ldquo;The Bear That Thought He Was a Dog,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Trail of the Vanishing
Herds,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Cabin Door,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Basket of Fish,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fisher in the
Chutes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Runner of the High Peaks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up a Tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the publication of the above volumes the usefulness
of the <i>Juvenile Library</i> is further extended. It is
the purpose of this series to present books for boys and
girls which have been approved as suitable reading by
those who have made a study of fiction for children.
Only those books the influence of which is undoubtedly
of the right kind are included. While this purpose is not
lost sight of, neither is the child&rsquo;s point of view neglected.
The stories are without exception of that entertaining
character that appeal strongly to the youngsters for whom
they were written.</p>
